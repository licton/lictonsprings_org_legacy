      <p> <font color="#003300" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 

        its first year as a community greenspace, our woodsy little street park 

        off Ashworth is doing well. Our small band of weeders and waterers have 

        been visiting regularly over the last twelve months, and our biggest fears 

        that the morning glory and blackberries would take over the site did not 

        materialize. However, they did mount a counterattack of tiny new starts 

        that had to be rooted up every two weeks or so. We also lost plants and 

        shrubs due to unknown causes-disease, soil conditions, etc. This was expected 

        though, and there is still a bounty of diverse growth going on. As soon 

        as the rains start, we won't be watering again until summer, but the weeding 

        will definitely continue through the Fall until things literally die down. 

        Please visit and enjoy! --Bob Messina, 528-7790</font></p>

        you seen it? If not, I'm sure you've smelled it-Wilson Pacific school 

        is getting a new roof. It turns out that all that stuff piled on the old 

        tennis courts is roofing material, but the pile should diminish as the 

        work is completed. That is good news. But the news about the inside of 

        the buildings is not so good. Currently the Wilson Pacific buildings hold 

        SPICE, Indian Heritage and several administration offices with more offices 

        coming this fall. CoHo School has permanently moved. SPICE is still active 

        at the site, but Indian Heritage is under stress, as their principal resigned 

        over the summer and they now share a principal with Marshall School. They 

        have been assigned an assistant principal/on-site manager, David Paul, 

        who's been given another year or two to make the program viable. Mr. Paul 

        is determined to do just that, but he needs community support. The administration 

        offices could and probably will move to the old Post Office building when 

        it becomes available, at which time the site may be used for a middle 

        school-its original purpose--or possibly be surplused, which would make 

        it available to this community. Whatever happens to the site I just hope 

        we don't have to watch it deteriorate daily as we have been these last 

        years. On October 1st the Indian Heritage Program sponsored a Powwow to 

        celebrate its 95th anniversary. It was very well attended. Their goal 

        is to grow and to implement an enriching curriculum that will make Indian 

        Heritage soar again. Community help would be appreciated, If you have 

        a desire to work for and with kids please contact David Paul at Indian 

        Heritage, -Liz Kearns </font></p>
