        <p align="center">   <font size="2"><b>November 4, 2005<br>

        </b></font><b><font size="2">Licton Springs Community Council Report for November<br>

        </font></b><b><font size="2">North Precinct Advisory Council Report for November

        2, 2005 </font></b></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2">From the onset of the meeting, President Pete Rogerson said it would

          be a little different, and it was. Our featured guest for the evening

          was to be Deputy Chief Clark Kimerer, but due to conflicting requirements

        he was not able to be in attendance. </font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2">The first order of business was to insure

            that there would be no repeat of the &ldquo;shouting match&rdquo; that highlighted last month&rsquo;s

          meeting (really bad form, you know!). President Rogerson let us all

          know that such antics would not be tolerated in the future. Enough

        said, eh? </font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2">Moving on, President Rogerson turned the meeting over to Acting Captain

          Mike Washburn for an update on the activities in the North Precinct.

        Over the last month things looked like this: </font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2">On October 13 th, there was an attempted robbery at a north end business,

          but when one of the patrons yelled at the knife brandishing crook,

          he fled. Someone else had noted the description of the get-away car

        and the suspect was taken into custody shortly thereafter. </font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2">On October 17 th, the North Precinct got a call about some suspicious

          activity in the parking lot of the Northgate Mall. A suspect was taken

          into custody and his vehicle searched. The result was a haul of about

        $36,000.00 worth of cocaine. </font></p>

        <p align="left">&nbsp; </p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2"> October 21 st had the arson investigators busy again.

            Fires were being set in dumpsters and vehicles. I guess they didn&rsquo;t

          catch anyone......yet. </font></p>

        <p align="left">&nbsp; </p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2"> A robbery and assault was attempted by a 40-year old

            man on the 24 th of October (along the Burke-Gilman Trail, I think).

            The victim put up a good fight and the crook got the &ldquo;Gray-Bar

          Hotel.&rdquo; </font></p>

        <p align="left">&nbsp; </p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2"> There were several &ldquo;Mary-Jane&rdquo; busts in the last month.

          They went down in the 4700 block of 12 th Northeast, and another in

          Lake City. The &ldquo;big one&rdquo; came on the tip from a local resident

          in the 700 block of 91 st Northeast. It seems that a &ldquo;rental

          house&rdquo; (with no occupants) was really a very large and sophisticated

          grow operation. </font></p>

        <p align="left">&nbsp; </p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2"> The long arm of the law will be looking into the details

            of &ldquo;who

          is involved&rdquo; in this one. The &ldquo;revolving door&rdquo; at

          drug court is turning a little harder these days. Those involved in

          drug-related crimes will stay in jail until they have been seen by

          a judge. In the past they only saw a &ldquo;booking clerk&rdquo; and

          were given a court date and released....not any more. </font></p>

        <p align="left">&nbsp; </p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2"> Diane Horswill (Crime Prevention Officer) reports

            that the number of &ldquo;walk-in&rdquo; burglaries is on the increase. People just

          don&rsquo;t seem to get the idea that they need to be locking their

          doors even when they are home or &ldquo;have just stepped out for a

          minute&rdquo;! Evidence shows that those that commit this type of crime

          just go door to door until they find one that is not locked and walk

          in. It&rsquo;s just that simple! </font></p>

        <p align="left">&nbsp; </p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2"> There have also been several incidents of people coming to the door

          and claiming to be someone from a City or County agency (City Light,

          water district, etc.) in an attempt to gain entry to the home. All

          real service agency personnel will have photo identification and will

          not mind showing it to you. ASK!!!!! </font></p>

        <p align="left">&nbsp; </p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2"> The newly formed &ldquo;GAIN&rdquo; was again well represented and

          reported that the most recent City Council meeting gave over an hour

          in discussion to the topic of &ldquo;public safety&rdquo; and the prospect

          of adding more police officers. Way to go! (Other topics and speakers

          got about ten to fifteen minutes?) </font></p>

        <p align="left">&nbsp; </p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2"> NPAC&rsquo;s George Holzapfel reported that there is about $55 Million

          surplus in the City budget for next year, however, about $29 Million

          of that is spoken for. Maybe the City Council will be persuaded by

          the likes of &ldquo;GAIN&rdquo; to shift a little more of that surplus

          to things like adding more police officers. For those that might like

          to follow the budget proceedings or express an opinion, the direct

          line to the council members is: <a href="mailto:budget@seattle.gov">budget@seattle.gov</a>. </font></p>

        <p align="left">&nbsp; </p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2"> Committee member Doug Thiel asked for input from the

            group about what topics might be &ldquo;hot button&rdquo; issues

          in the future. Some of the suggestions were: </font></p>

        <p align="left">&nbsp; </p>

        <div align="left">

          <ul>

            <li><font size="2"> The City&rsquo;s &ldquo;revolving door&rdquo; policy

                    for criminals. (We might invite more judges to be guest speakers.

                  They are always informative and enlightening.) </font></li>

              <li><font size="2"> How to deal with the &ldquo;Drunk and Disorderly&rdquo; (being

                  drunk is not a crime, being disorderly is). </font></li>

              <li><font size="2"> We should invite someone from the area of mental health professionals

                  to speak on the topic of mental health as it applies to those living

                  on the street. </font></li>

              <li><font size="2"> Someone to address the ongoing problem of prostitution along the

                  Aurora (Highway 99) corridor. </font></li>

              <li><font size="2"> What can be done about the problem of &ldquo;auto-camping&rdquo; (can

                  anything be done)? </font></li>

          </ul>
