        North Precinct Advisory Council Report for February 2, 2005</font></h4>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span

style='layout-grid-mode:line'><em>Statements or opinions expressed in the following 

        report are not necessarily those of the Licton Springs Community Council

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At 

        7:02 p.m. President Pete Rogerson called the meeting to order. There was 

        one new member in attendance this month, and that was the representative 

        from the Ramada Inn and Berkshire Grill.<br>

        The evening&#8217;s agenda had us covering several different subjects. 

        First up was Sergeant Don Smith from the Traffic Division. He spoke to 

        the issue of the &#8220;Community Traffic Complaint.&#8221; The traffic 

        section is charged with ensuring quality law enforcement to the citizens 

        of Seattle and the &#8220;Community Traffic Complaint&#8221; was established 

        to facilitate that goal. The traffic section seeks to identify those areas 

        within the city that have a disproportionate number of complaints or accidents. 

        One such location is at the location of 128th and Aurora Avenue (Highway 

        99). That location is noted as a &#8220;high impact&#8221; area (no pun 

        intended). Another problem area is the area between the Northgate Mall 

        and the Target store on 110th Street. Jaywalking in this area has become 

        epidemic. (No one can use the crosswalks at the end or middle of the block 

        - too far to walk?) It was also noted that 50 percent of pedestrian deaths 

        are the fault of the pedestrian. (If you run down a pedestrian, you&#8217;ll 

        get a citation!) <br>

        <br>

        If a citizen makes a complaint with regard to a traffic issue, the Traffic 

        Section WILL respond! There will be more on this subject again next month. 

        If you&#8217;re interested, come to the meeting. (All are welcome - no 

        door prizes but there&#8217;s also no cover charge.) </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moving 

        Forward, Next, we got a shortened dissertation on the Department&#8217;s 

        &#8220;Mobile Based Computers.&#8221; These are the computers that are 

        seen in the front seat of all patrol cars. The &#8220;in car&#8221; computers 

        have given the patrol officer instant access to information that would 

        have taken hours to process in the past. The computers can be used via 

        the keyboard or through a touch screen entry. Since they are being used 

        in an automobile, the computers are &#8220;hardened&#8221; against the 

        rough environment in which they must work. They are also mounted high 

        so the officer need not take his eyes off the road. The system in use 

        is an &#8220;in house&#8221; design (designed by cops for use by cops). 

        The system works much like a cell phone. It does not rely on a central 

        server, and is therefore little affected by natural disasters. (A good 

        thing if we have one!) The system provides information access from both 

        State and Federal data sources. Information is displayed in an array of 

        colors to signify priority. (Red is the hot number.) The data display 

        is much the same as it would be on a home computer and communication is 

        very much like e-mail or instant messaging. Having an on-board computer 

        really does make the best use of an officer&#8217;s time. (They can write 

        reports while still in the field, etc.) The question was raised about 

        the potential for abuse of the access of individual information and the 

        response was that the system is audited at all times. (You can&#8217;t 

        be checking up on your ex-girlfriend.)</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 

        There was a lot more to this meeting, but these guys all talk fast and 

        I write slowly. (They all do community presentations also.)<br>

        The heads of North Precinct Operations, Lieutenant Roy Wedlund and Captain 

        Oliver, had a few closing notes as well. The Seattle Police cars all carry 

        &#8220;spike strips&#8221; to deflate tires of suspect cars. This helps 

        avoid the type of thing that just happened over on I-90 when an officer 

        had to shoot out the tires of the car being used by the bad guys (aka, 

        no stray bullets flying around).<br>

        There are now 15 patrol cars in operation for the North Precinct that 

        are equipped with video cameras. These are a great aid when it comes to 

        providing proof of actions when making a stop or arresting a suspect.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 

        The North Precinct now has its very own Department of Corrections (&#8220;DoC&#8221;) 

        Officer. Working hand in hand with the regular patrol officers, the DoC 

        Officer is able to make arrests for parole violations by those on release 

        from prison. Since the first of the year, over 130 contacts have been 

        made and 40 arrests are the result. I found a little dry humor in the 

        aspect of having a DoC officer putting parole violators back in prison 

        when the parole board keeps saying we have an overcrowded system and turns 

        more of them loose! (It&#8217;s like a merry-go-round, eh?)</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 

        At the beginning of the meeting, President Rogerson gave a little pep 

        talk about &#8220;sharing&#8221; the information garnered from these meetings. 

        It is not enough just to come and be represented. Ideally, the topics 

        discussed at these meetings (all public safety related) should be spread 

        as far as possible. If you have any friends, co-workers, relatives, or 

        people you just don&#8217;t like-spread the word! Is it asking too much 

        to help keep as many people as possible &#8220;informed&#8221;? Admittedly, 

        this month&#8217;s report is not one of my better efforts, but I&#8217;ll 

        do what I can with whatever I have to work with. Remember, I flunked English, 

        &#8216;nough said.</font></p>
