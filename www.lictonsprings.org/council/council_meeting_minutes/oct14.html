Over the weekend of Saturday and Sunday, October 11 and 12, an
offshoot of Tent City 3 moved into Licton Springs Park.  The Tent
City folks are scheduled to be at SPU January 1</FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">st</FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">.
 Kathleen Braden told us that SPU is talking to the City about the
possibility of moving Tent City earlier because of their present
problem of no place to be.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Liz
Kearns reported that neighbors have called the Mayor’s office and
other City offices but have been unable to reach anyone.  Messages
have been left, but there have been no calls returned.  This is very
upsetting.  The Tent City 3 offshoot group did not go through the
established processes.  No one knew they would camp at Licton Springs
Park.  This has raised concerns.  Isn’t it illegal to camp
overnight in a City park?</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Discussion
followed.  The Sharewheel organization assists the Tent City groups. 
There has apparently been a rupture in the Tent City 3 group.  There
is a neighbor who has been harassing the group.  That neighbor has
been reported to the police by the Tent City group.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">The
Tent City 3 offshoot group has been served with an eviction notice
that requires them to be gone by 2:00 p.m. on October 16, 2014.  We
need to have a contingency plan on what steps we should take if, in
fact, the group does not leave the Park.</FONT><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="oct14.html#sdfootnote1sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Concern
was voiced for the people of Tent City.  Jan suggested needing to
find a permanent location, i.e., the lawn bowling clubhouse (which
has a kitchen and bathrooms) at Lower Woodland or a barrack at Fort
Lawton.  Carlos Sanabria stated that we need to be careful and
sensitive in our communications with the City.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">We
would like a response from the City to safety concerns.  Is there a
stepped up security plan if the tents are allowed to remain encamped
in a City park illegally?  Jan will craft a letter and send it to
Ellen Beck to forward to everyone at our meeting to comment on.  We
need to suggest sensible, tactful actions.  If the group is allowed
to remain, what remediation does our neighborhood receive?  It was
suggested that Christa Dumpys and Thomas Whittemore (both with the
DON) might have suggestions for us.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">We
are owed a safety plan if the Tent City 3 offshoot is still camped in

Difficulties</U></FONT><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">.  The ballot
transportation measure was discussed.  Jan noted that our transit
problems began in the 1990’s when King County and Metro were merged
and in response Sound Transit was formed, resulting in an unfair
allocation of transportation income and costs.  Our local transit has
suffered as a result.</FONT></P>

has promoted and worked with Bike Share Co. to install stations with
bikes in those cities and now in Seattle.  Discussion followed.  What
is the City receiving for the installation of these bike stands on
City sidewalks?  This all happened quite suddenly.  Was there open
bidding in connection with installation of a bike share program in
Seattle?</FONT></P>

	Following our meeting, Kathleen Braden stopped by the Park.  The
	tents were being taken down and stuff was being loaded into
	vehicles.  Kathleen talked to their leader, Tony, who said that
	because they would be evicted tomorrow, they are leaving tonight. 
	Tony will return tomorrow to make such everything is in order.  He
	didn’t know where they were going, but they were not rejoining the
	main Tent City 3 group.  </FONT>
