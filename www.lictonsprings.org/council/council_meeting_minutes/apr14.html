Dougherty explained about the Safe Routes to Schools program, which
is funded by Bridging the Gap funds.  The program works to update and
restore around schools to bring safety for walking/biking to school. 
Among the actions taken are:  installing school speed zones, traffic
signals, traffic calming, safety items: remarking crosswalks,
installing place-making, curb bulbs, and ensuring smooth sidewalks.</FONT></P>

Ellen Beck read an e-mail from Liz Kearns, who was unable to attend
our meeting.  Liz had spoken with Tom Redman, Capital
Communications, Seattle Public Schools, today.  He told her that the
Pinehurst K-8/Indian Heritage program has decided to change its name.
 They have ten suggestions, but seem to like Licton Springs K-8 as it
covers the Indian Heritage and location of the program.  They wonder
if LSCC would support this idea.</FONT></P>

Stepherson Associates, and Art Brochet, the Communications Lead for
the Seattle Department of Transportation will make a quick update,

Street.  Sarah said that there had been 109 comments regarding
relocation of the lines.  She expected to receive copies of those
comments.  She said the audience at the Haller Lake meeting displayed
anger and dismay because the Sound Transit representatives answered
very few questions, especially why it was best to relocate the lines
onto Meridian Avenue North and North 115</FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">th</FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">
Street.  She has learned that only two poles are a problem,
necessitating the relocation of the line.  It seemed to Sarah that
Sound Transit had sent executives who really didn’t know the
answers to questions.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Discussion

Pacific SEPA</U></FONT><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">.  Melanie
commented on the need for the routing of buses to be considered. 
Also the community should be informed of events taking place at the
schools.  She also suggested that a bicycle connection at 92</FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">nd</FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">
needed consideration.  At present there is inadequate bicycle access.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Melanie
said there were a lot of hoops because of Pilling’s Pond, which the
School District is not going to touch.  Water coming to the Pond will
not be touched.  The School District will have to make adequate
provisions for the detention/retention for water/flooding.</FONT></P>

informed us that we live in a high particulate zone lying between the

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Ken
told us that there is a plan now to have all the precinct picnics at
one location.  This will save money because of not having to transmit
the various special units around to all the precincts.  Even though
this would save money, it didn’t seem to us that it would be well
attended because of the size of the crowd would be a difficulty, as
well as getting to the location.  At present, we walk to the North
Precinct for the picnic.  If it was at a central location, there
would have be parking available for all neighborhoods!</FONT></P>
