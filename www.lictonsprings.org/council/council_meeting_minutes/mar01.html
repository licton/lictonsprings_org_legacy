        reflecting LSCC’s balance being $1,084.34 as of March&nbsp;20, 2001.  

        Debra said that a budget for 2001 needs to be formulated.  She also suggested 

        that the Board establish checks, balances, and protocols for our accounting 

        of funds received.  Jan Brucker said that funding agencies have rules, 

        guidelines and protocols established that we would need to follow.  Debra 

        will send around an e-mail to schedule a meeting regarding the 2001 budget 

        and budget protocols.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>NEW 

        BUSINESS:</u></b></font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Liz Kearns 

        first explained the Licton Springs Community Master Plan for the Wilson-Pacific 

        area and surrounds (including Pillings Pond).</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Seattle 

        School Board Member Steve Brown</u> again introduced himself and told 

        a bit about him and his family.  He has been on the School Board for 15 

        months and is one of the two newer members.  He and his family live on 

        the east side of Green Lake and he and his wife have two children, a sixth 

        grader and a fourth grader, both in Seattle Public Schools.  Steve told 

        us that the Board meets twice a month, but also has committee meetings.  

        The Board sets the overall policy for the School District and also performs 

        oversight functions.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Steve 

        said that the School Board had been receiving pressure from parents to 

        make Wilson-Pacific a middle school with 600 to 800 students.  At present, 

        though, no decision has been made.  The School District is now having 

        work sessions on plan implementation, including the optimum size of middle 

        and high schools.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jan 

        Brucker gave the background of the community’s efforts and support of 

        Wilson-Pacific as a functioning school.  The community is interested in 

        not just having a school at the Wilson-Pacific site, but also being able 

        to carry on neighborhood programs there.  Jan made a plea for a mechanism/dialogue 

        for school issues and facilities.  The Licton Springs Community is very 

        concerned about the Wilson-Pacific site.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Steve 

        Brown said that he believed the School District had school space for the 

        number of students enrolled, but that there was overcrowding because of 

        students’ preferences for certain popular schools.  He said that the School 

        District had to determine a philosophy for the future:  What direction 

        are schools going?  Does smaller equal better?  He said that whatever 

        discussion took place at the high school level would also be taking place 

        at the middle school level.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jan 

        Brucker asked about long-term plans for the site.  If Wilson-Pacific is 

        not a school, what will it become?  The Community wants to be involved 

        in the discussion process.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Steve 

        gave the three categories of School District properties:  (i) essential, 

        (ii) interim, and (iii) surplus.  He said that the School Board discusses 

        and votes on where to categorize School District properties.  At present, 

        Wilson-Pacific is not considered in the surplus category.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Various 

        questions were asked by those present.  Bert Bradley asked for suggestions 

        for effective ways to advocate our preferences.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Steve 

        Brown gave three suggestions:  (i) attend meetings<a href="mar01.html#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span>[1]</span></a> 

        which are held the first and third Wednesdays of the month (check web-page 

        for when they are, or call Becky Taylor at 252-0040); (ii) continue to 

        call Kathy Johnson and keep meeting with School Board members; and (iii) 

        initiate and maintain informal contacts with Board members.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jan 

        Brucker asked what the School Board’s policy was for involving neighborhoods.  

        Steve said that there was no formal policy, <u>but</u> working with communities 

        is in the <u>goals</u> for this academic year.  Principals now have as 

        part of their job description that they are to work with the community 

        in which their school is situated.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bob 

        Messina brought up the Wilson-Pacific ball fields and possible amenities 

        for the public and incorporating Pillings Pond into this general plan.  

        Bob mentioned the Memory Walk Park at John Hay Elementary that Gary Payton 

        donated funding for in memory of the people, especially the children, 

        lost in the Alaska Airlines crash.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Steve 

        Brown said that the School District does have a new sensibility and more 

        dialogue with the communities, but that it was easier to make that happen 

        if a school site exists.  It is harder at present for the Wilson-Pacific 

        site because that site is not firmly categorized for the long term.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Steve 

        Brown was thanked by the Council for his attendance at our meeting.  Liz 

        said that we should also invite Barbara Peterson to a future Council meeting.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Next, 

        we had a second round of introductions for Judy Nicastro who arrived after 

        our meeting had started.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Seattle 

        City Councilwoman Judy Nicastro</u> addressed the group.  She said that 

        her day had begun with Licton Springs (having a tour of Pillings Pond) 

        and ended with Licton Springs (at our meeting).  Judy Nicastro was elected 

        last year on a renters’ rights platform.  She talked about work that she 

        has been involved with on the City Council.<a

href="mar01.html#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span>[2]</span></a></font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jan 

        Brucker brought up the concerns of the community regarding increased density.  

        She said that the City Council needs to keep in mind that when density 

        is increased, the stresses on the infrastructure (i.e., less water pressure) 

        also are increased and this affects the quality of life.  Jan also suggested 

        making use of alleys as pedestrian pathways.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Judy 

        Nicastro said that she could see hard times ahead for the City for the 

        next couple of years.  She said there would not be as much “fat” in the 

        budgets.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Next 

        a discussion took place regarding mother-in-law units and people’s positions 

        on this topic, since this was a way to increase density.  Those present 

        were all in favor of mother-in-law units as long as the home was owner-occupied 

        and there was adequate parking space for additional residents.  Judy Nicastro 

        stated that the regulations had been changed in connection with mother-in-law 

        units and the permit process was easier for citizens.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jan 

        Brucker asked if Judy Nicastro had ever toured NSCC, the north-end wetlands, 

        etc.  A discussion followed about Northgate and the Northgate Transit 

        Center being cut off from people on the west side, including students 

        of NSCC and residents.  A better connection with the east side of the 

        freeway is important.  A discussion needs to be established with the DOT 

        regarding the I-5 corridor.  If the State is considering significant revamping 

        near Northgate, it’s a perfect time to look at our access needs.  Judy 

        Nicastro also suggested bringing Councilman McIver into the discussion 

        since he focuses on transportation.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Judy 

        next outlined issues for the future:  (i) protection of domestic violence 

        victims so that they could not be denied housing, etc.; and (ii) what 

        can be done to alleviate tax assessments for landlords who keep rents 

        below market.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 

        discussion of staffing at the City Council level was discussed.  It was 

        pointed out that the King County Council has much more support.  Judy 

        Nicastro said that she appreciated the desire of the community to have 

        City Council have more support staff, but that she didn’t see it happening 

        because of budgeting.  The discussion then flowed to the effects of contracting 

        out jobs (i.e., to other companies in the City or even out of state) and 

        why it was done.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Liz 

        Kearns told Judy Nicastro about the upcoming meeting regarding the master 

        plan for the Wilson-Pacific/Pillings Pond/ball fields area.  She said 

        that Mayor Schell and School Superintendent Olchefske will be invited, 

        as well as others representing SPU, the Parks Department, and SeaTran.  

        This gathering was the original idea of Phil Fujii.  It is important to 

        bring all “heads” together to develop a master plan for the Wilson-Pacific 

        site.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jan 

        Brucker added that the meeting would take place the end of April/first 

        part of May and would be a springboard from the neighborhood plan to the 

        present and would have as its goal getting integration for all work needing 

        to be done.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Judy 

        Nicastro next talked about the Mardi Gras violence.  She said that she 

        had been able to begin a dialogue with young people involved in violence 

        because of an article written about her in <i>The Stranger</i> that had 

        prompted young people to call her.  She said she was attempting to set 

        up a meeting of these young people and Council members.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jan 

        Brucker pointed out that one of the problems was that there were not enough 

        facilities for pick up games – that facilities were monopolized by organized 

        teams/sports.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Board 

        of Directors</u>.  Liz asked Ellen to read the names of directors with 

        terms expiring in 2001.  They are Jerry Owens, John Meerscheidt, Debra 

        Willendorf, and Yvonne Zoretic.  All these directors indicated a willingness 

        to keep serving on the Board.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jan 

        Brucker announced her resignation after six plus years on the Board, including 

        two years as president and two years being one of the heads of our neighborhood 

        planning committee.  Jan also was responsible for approaching Bert Bradley 

        about his willingness to serve on the Board.  Bert was the transportation 

        committee chairman for the neighborhood planning committee.  Bert was 

        unanimously elected to fulfill Jan’s Board term.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Belinda 

        Gigliotti</u>, Seattle Parks Department Northwest Sector Manager, spoke 

        next.  She confirmed that the comfort station in the Licton Springs Park 

        will be remodeled.  Belinda also told us that the timeline for North Park 

        shows that it will get funding earlier rather than later.  She also reminded 

        folks of the March 31 work party at Licton Springs Park.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>North 

        Seattle Community College</u>.  Wally Fosmore announced that landscape 

        renovation of the central courtyard at the College had begun on Monday.  

        He said he thought everyone would be very pleased with the courtyard after 

        completion.  There will be a water feature.  All overgrown plants are 

        going to be removed.  He said that the number of trees would decrease 

        from 41 to 38.  Wally also announced that there would be a 30 year reunion 

        for alumni on April 21<sup>st</sup>.  He said there would be an alumni 

        recognition night and that it would be the kick off event for the Alumni 

        Association.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wally 

        also said that the College was doing a seismic upgrade on the skybridge.  

        Doing this at the same time as the central courtyard renovation would 

        conserve money and efforts.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Pillings
