        Randy Elder regretfully gave up his Board seat late last year due to purchasing 

        a home outside of our community.  Liz announced that Yvonne Zoretic, granddaughter 

        of Chuck Pillings and a member of this community, had indicated her willingness 

        to serve.  Liz inquired if anyone else was interested in joining the Board 

        at the present time.  Hearing no stated interest, Liz moved that Yvonne 

        Zoretic be elected to complete Randy Elder’s term on the Board.  Yvonne 

        next was asked to tell something about herself.  She related that she 

        has lived in the community since 1994.  She got married in 1997, and she 

        and her husband live in the home next-door to her grandfather.  Yvonne 

        said she was interested in working on the “Pillings Pond committee.”  

        Yvonne was unanimously elected.  Thank you for your interest and willingness 

        to work on the Community Council, Yvonne!</font></p>

        Mimi Sheridan and Carol Tobin gave an update of the historical materials 

        they have gathered and the sources they have used to obtain the information 

        thus far compiled in connection with researching the history of our neighborhood.  

        The materials, which are voluminous, will not all fit into the community 

        brochure to be developed, but all materials will be given to the Council.  

        They have information on the prehistory, Native American history, natural 

        history, and the early white settlement (by the Denny family).  They have 

        conducted numerous oral life histories of individuals, including Chuck 

        Pillings, and have also traced property ownership and physical development 

        of the neighborhood.  The history of public institutions, post war development 

        of Northgate and the freeway, the Hadley family and their skating rink, 

        etc. is included, as well as the Interurban, Aurora, Aurora cutting through 

        Woodland Park, the Aurora Bridge, and the oldest structures on Aurora 

        Avenue.  Mimi and Carol asked for suggestions and received feedback.  

        Native American history was emphasized as needing to be included.  Everyone 

        was fascinated and very impressed with the wealth of information and history 

        already gathered for the community!  It is exciting to have this project 

        ongoing and we eagerly await the historical brochure.</font></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Seattle Planning Commission Survey</span></u></b>:  

        Paul Tomita explained that he is a citizen volunteer and at our meeting 

        to ask us questions regarding our community planning process.  The Planning 

        Commission, of which he is a member, consists of 15 volunteers who make 

        up an oversight group that acts in an advisory capacity to the City Council 

        and Mayor.  Meghan Stedman came with Paul to our meeting to take notes.  

        She said the Council will receive a written report of the survey results.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300">Paul 

        asked for our positive/negative experiences on how our neighborhood plan 

        is going and how we feel about the stewardship support offered by the 

        City Department of Neighborhoods, etc.  He asked for our main goals coming 

        out of neighborhood planning.  Jan Brucker responded regarding developing 

        a commercial area to the east of Aurora at several locations.  Jan said 

        that we needed to have support similar to the Northgate workshops to get 

        people focused on thinking about alternatives and possibilities.  Secondly 

        Jan mentioned Wilson Pacific as being very important to the community.  

        She said that the neighborhood really needs help bringing the School District 

        to the table and setting up a line of communication.  With the School 

        District consolidating and moving into the remodeled post office building 

        south of downtown, it is our understanding that Wilson Pacific will be 

        vacated.  What are the plans for that site?  The community has long desired 

        a presence in that facility.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300">Phil 

        Fuji noted that the Department now has dedicated individuals working with 

        neighborhoods.  He felt this had improved communication and was helpful 

        because the neighborhoods knew who to contact.  Phil was sorry to have 

        to inform us that Christopher Williams is leaving our area to work in 

        the Southeast Region.  Liz added that she knew Christopher was excited 

        about this because it would be a challenge and the Southeast Region does 

        not have the facilities that exist in other parts of the City.  Phil said 

        that they were working on getting us someone else who would work equally 

        hard on our concerns and interests.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300">Paul 

        Tomita asked how our EIF funds had been used.  Liz noted that we had used 

        EIF funds for our Newsletter (outreach), the History Project, North Park 

        (developing a park plan for the portion of the property not used as part 

        of the Disc Golf course), and for a new informational kiosk (at Licton 

        Springs Park).</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300">Jan 

        Brucker said that she felt communities should be brought into the budgeting 

        process and be able to have input at the earlier stages of formalizing 

        the budget.  Phil agreed that this was a good point and noted that the 

        City is going on a biennial budget.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300">Phil 

        again mentioned the possibility of exploring sidewalk alternatives for 

        100<sup>th</sup>.  He mentioned exploring a demonstration fund of $500,000.00 

        for additional sidewalk alternatives.</font></p>

        response to Paul was very positive with regards to help, guidance, funding 

        we have thus far received from the Department of Neighborhoods and the 

        Parks Department.</span></font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Paul 

        thanked us for our input and said he was impressed with the work of the 

        Board and he noted that we certainly did seem to have our projects well 

        organized and well underway.</span></font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300"><b><u><span

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Friends of Pillings Pond</span></u></b>:  

        Bob Messina related how he had become aware of funding available through 

        Cynthia Sullivan’s office in a conversation he had with Andrew Schmid.  

        Andrew Schmid also gave information about the funding available, which 

        is <u>not</u> linked to matching funds.  He said there was a total of 

        $30,000.00 in a Special Projects Fund which is available to be divided 

        among three neighborhoods.  LSCC could apply for a $10,000.00 grant to 

        hire a consultant for the Pillings Pond project.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300">Off 

        the subject momentarily, Andrew also advised us that the Council should 

        look to the Wallingford community for design guidelines.  Wallingford 

        has completed a design review project.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300">Also, 

        for traffic concerns, Fremont has used a computer model.  Andrew said 

        we could also contact Steve Louie of the Lake Union District Council.  

        Also, urban designers have boilerplates and a lot of experience in this 

        area, plus DCLU will provide staff support.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300">Back 

        to Pillings Pond – a project monitor will be assigned for the project.  

        He mentioned it could possibly be someone like Steve Humphries of King 

        County Parks.  Andrew said that there would be additional funds available 

        in the 2002 budget.  He advised the greater benefits of getting King County 

        involved because this brings in a lot more funding and help with drainage 

        issues.  Andrew noted that capital project funds for the county involve 

        large money funds.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300">Phil 

        Fuji noted that the City could possibly want ownership until the drainage 

        problems are resolved.  It is important to get the School District to 

        cooperate and work with Licton Springs on Pillings Pond.  It is crucial 

        that the various agencies with interests get coordinated so that the best 

        use is made of available assistance.  It is vital to have everyone on 

        the same page at the outset rather than coming in later.  Perhaps a tour 

        could be arranged, etc., and a kick-off event planned.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The 

        consultant to be hired would bring out all the options available and educate 

        us on the possibilities available to us with this project.</span></font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300">Andrew 

        said that the State Legislature is also a place to look.  We could contact 

        the Washington Wildlife and Recreation Coalition/Interagency Committee 

        for Outdoor Recreation (name not 100% accurate perhaps).  This is a large 

        agency that is relatively unknown.  It has funds available to buy rural 

        and urban parcels.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300">Following 

        the above discussion, a motion was made by Wanda Fullner, “That the Council 

        establish the Pillings Pond Committee and appoint Wanda Fullner and Bob 

        Messina as co-chairs, with Debra Willendorf and Yvonne Zoretic also on 

        the Committee.”  This motion was passed unanimously.  Wanda announced 

        that the Committee would meet on Monday evening, 6:00 p.m. in Room 307, 

        Wilson Pacific.  Location to be confirmed.  Andrew Schmid said he would 

        attend the meeting.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300">Phil 

        Fuji passed out information regarding a Stakeholders’ Workshop for the 

        2001 Combined Sewer Overflow Reduction Plan Amendment Project to be held 

        on Thursday, January&nbsp;8, 2001.  It is hosted by Seattle Public Utilities.
