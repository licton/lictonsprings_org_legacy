              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Treasurer

                  Debra provided a Treasurer&rsquo;s

                  Report covering January 1, 2006 through April 18, 2006. A general

                  discussion followed. Debra asked us to address the budgeted

                  items. She said last year we just stayed with the same budget

                  as the year before, without formally approving a 2005 budget.

                  The only item Debra proposed changing for 2006 was the $24.00

                  designated for publicity with the <i>Seattle Sun</i>. It was

                  agreed that we did not use this budgeted amount and that it

                  should be returned to the general fund. With this change, the

                  budget for 2006 was adopted, and the Treasurer&rsquo;s Report

                approved.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A discussion followed on two events in our budget that the

                Licton Springs Community Council sponsors, Halloween in the Park,

                and the Picnic in the Park. </font></p>

              <p align="left"> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Halloween in the Park</b> Liz

                  explained that we owe a huge debt to Betsy Weill for her work

                  on the Halloween event. Betsy really makes it happen. LSCC

                  sends out letters requesting candy donations, but Betsy and

                  her teacher friends become the &ldquo;Friends

                of the Forest,&rdquo; who the kids trick-or-treat from as they

                go around the Park. Liz told of dressing up in her clown outfit

                - all the outfits are priceless! Besides the candy, we provide

                hot apple cider and Phil provides musical entertainment &ndash; mostly

                polkas, and it becomes a very festive evening, very well attended.

                There are &ldquo;Friends of the Forest&rdquo; who light the pathway

                also, which is essential on a dark Halloween night. There is

                a donation basket and we receive donations that mostly cover

                the out-of-pocket expenses of the event. Last year we received

                $108.70 in donations.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It was agreed that we should do a very special thank you to

                Betsy.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Thanks

                  also go to Pilling&rsquo;s

                  Pond Preservation Society for allowing us to use its 501(c)(3).

                  In years past it was enough to be a community council and write

                  a letter requesting donations, but now we need to have 501(c)(3)

                status to obtain donations.</font></p>

              <p align="left"> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Picnic in the Park</b> We

                  have been able to put on our community picnic because of Larry&rsquo;s Market&rsquo;s

                generous donation of hotdogs and the cooking of same, plus hotdog

                buns and soft drinks. LSCC provides paper products, catsup, mustard,

                relish, and entertainment. Community members traditionally bring

                cookies, brownies, raw vegetables, etc. (The community donations

                vary from year to year.)</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We

                  had feared that Larry&rsquo;s

                  was being sold and so, without their assistance the picnic

                  would be impossible to keep going with its traditional grilled

                hotdogs.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Liz

                  explained that the original &ldquo;Larry&rdquo; had retired

                and turned the stores over to his son. Under the son&rsquo;s

                management, the stores didn&rsquo;t do so well. Now, a corporation

                runs the stores and the Oak Tree Village Larry&rsquo;s is now

                making money. The manager of Larry&rsquo;s wants to do our picnic

                (if he is still there). The grills that have been used in the

                past have been sold, but Larry&rsquo;s manager said he could

                get a hold of grills to do the hotdogs.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Based

                  on optimism that Larry&rsquo;s will continue their traditional

                role, and that we could hold a different type of community event

                without Larry&rsquo;s, Liz asked for the agreement of all that

                the Bubbleman and marimba band contracts should be finalized.

                This was agreed. </font></p>

                  raised a question from the new owner of the Pilling&rsquo;s

                  Pond property. There seems to be less water and the water has

                a milky color. Why is this? </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Liz

                  said she couldn&rsquo;t be

                  entirely sure, but knew that the path that water takes changes

                  because of changes in the neighborhood. Water takes the path

                  of least resistance. Right now there is a lot of construction

                  in the neighborhood. Compared to earlier years at the Park,

                  the same amount of water is coming from the spring, but there

                is a lot more runoff. </font></p>

              <p align="left"> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Disaster List Serve</b> Liz

                  gave Debra information on the disaster list serve. Discussion

                  followed. Once the list serve is set up, we have to have information

                  to send the members. They would get an initial &ldquo;welcome to&rdquo; message, but then there had

                to be a plan for future mailings that would interest these people.

                It was decided that information about the &ldquo;Night Out&rdquo; project

                would be good to send. </font></p>

              <p align="left"> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Night Out</b> This

                  annual event is going to be August 1 st. Discussion followed.

                  We need to encourage more people to have &ldquo;nights

                out&rdquo; on their block. We could perhaps do flyers, and we

                could have Shannon send an announcement to the LSCC list serve. </font></p>

              <p align="left"> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>NORC</b> Through

                  the Police Precinct we received a copy of a letter sent to

                  Chief Gil Kerlikowske from NORC, A National Organization for

                  Research at the University of Chicago. The letter states that

                  NORC is sponsored by the National Science Foundation, and wants

                  to do a national social survey in Seattle. They want to obtain &ldquo;an objective and representative reflection

                of the changing ideas, beliefs, and opinions of American residents.&rdquo; After

                discussion, it was decided that we didn&rsquo;t feel any action

                was warranted on our part. We hoped that the people answer the

                telephones at 911 would be knowledgeable about this survey because

                they are sure to get calls when people are contacted to participate

              in an in-house survey (out of the blue). </font></p>

              <p align="left"> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Northgate Festival</b> We have received information

                booth will be available for each neighborhood that wishes to

                have one. Discussion followed regarding information we could

                provide if we had a Licton Springs booth. Liz suggested taking

                apart two of the history brochures and mounting the pages on

                a display. We could not give away brochures at our booth because

                we do not have enough of these brochures left.</font></p>

                as a History Brochure. At present, we do not have enough History

                Brochures to do this, and also not the funds to pay for more

                Brochures. Liz said that in the future we could make an application

                for a Small &amp; Simple grant to get more History Brochures

                Brochure for future use. The answer was YES.</font></p>

              <p align="left"> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Wetlands Brochure</b> Liz said that the wetlands

              <p align="left"> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Houses on College Way</b> Liz had received information

                from Dave Barber on the three houses on College Way just north

                of the house next to the series of Victorian skinny houses. Parking

                violations had been reported and as a result, the vehicles are

                no longer parked on the grass, but are shuffled among the three

                houses, one of which appears to be vacant. One woman owns all

                three houses (an absentee owner). The consensus opinion was that

                the owner must be waiting for a future offer for the houses since

                she could not possibly be earning much rent from them. A new

                owner would remove the existing houses and build something new.

                Nothing can really be done, other than to monitor what is happening

                with the houses and report any code violations.</font></p>

                The neighborhood has become incredibly dense in proportion to

              <p align="left"> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Wilson-Pacific School</b> Liz reported that Wilson-Pacific

                could be on the list of schools to be possibly closed. This is

                a great cause for concern for us. It seems that the Seattle School

                District is following the same path with Wilson-Pacific as they

                did with the Bitter Lake School. The trucks and landscaping crews

                that previously were at Bitter Lake, are now at Wilson. Wilson

                had the added problem of asbestos.</font></p>

                  Hammer, a resident at 100 th and Wallingford had complained

                  about the cost of the RPZ. He said the cost had gone up and

                  what was to keep it from getting more and more expensive? Discussion

                  followed. Kay remembered that it had cost $15.00 the last time

                  she had renewed her guest parking permit, and that the permit

                  was good for two years. The consensus was that the College

                  would continue to pay for homeowners&rsquo; costs

                in connection with the RPZ.</font></p>

                  Morrison has completed his studies at the Museum School of

                  Fine Art in Boston, and is going to be doing another panel

                  of art on the east wall of Wilson-Pacific. He has received

                  a Potlatch Fund grant to do this project. Liz said she was

                  suggesting to Andrew that he use the far north panel, so that

                  there would be Chief Joseph&rsquo;s spray paint painting,

                then two empty panels, and then the new art. Liz said Andrew

                had very definite ideas, so she wasn&rsquo;t sure what he would

                do. Andrew Morrison&rsquo;s website is <a href="http://onestaa.com/">http://www.onestaa.com</a>.

                  concerning asking Park visitors to pick up their dog&rsquo;s

                  poop when walking in the Park. Liz said she would request plastic

                  Council. She thanked Debra for speaking with Mike about this

                if she was interesting in becoming a Board member. Kay said she

                was and a joyful vote was taken. Kay was unanimously elected

                to the Licton Springs Community Council Board of Directors, with

                her initial term expiring in 2007.

                This group ultimately requires one additional director (it is

                a group of four). The group of directors with terms beginning

                and ending in even years consists of Liz Kearns and Ellen Beck.

                This group ultimately requires three additional directors (it

                is a group of five). If all positions are filled, LSCC has nine
