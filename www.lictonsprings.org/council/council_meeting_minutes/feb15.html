from 10:00&nbsp;a.m. to noon, in the lunchroom at the College.  The

side.  Discussion followed.  There is a current Senate bill with $10
million to be voted on.  Art Brocaw with Seattle Department of
Transportation will make the presentation.  Dr. Brown will be at the
meeting on behalf of the College, or someone else if he is not
available.  Lee Bruch will make a presentation on other

can send notice of the meeting to the LSCC list serve folks and get
the message out on Nextdoor.  Arrangements will be made to have
water, coffee, tea, etc., and something to eat.  It was estimated
that this would cost $250.00.  It was believed that the Expresso Bar
would also be available.</FONT></P>

Leaf supports the pedestrian bridge, as well as Mayor Murray and
North Seattle College.  Tom Meyer reported that some of the
representatives at the Northwest District Council are not in favor. 
He felt this was a funding issue for them.  The Aurora Merchants’
representative is not in favor.  Those opposed believe the money
should be spent for other needs, i.e., pedestrian issues, sidewalks,
curbs, traffic lights, water and drainage issues, etc.</FONT></P>

need to gather opinions of the people who come to the meeting.  This
could be done by putting dots on a chart or some other way. 
Discussion followed regarding refreshments and tallying of opinions. 
John Figge can take the pulse on campus.  How will it tee into
pedestrian/bike plans.  John committed to also seeing that signs get
put up.</FONT></P>

via a safe route.  He said a study was needed of 92</FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">nd</FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">

responded to a question about having two topics at our neighborhood
meeting on Saturday.  We don’t have big meetings often, so two
issues (pedestrian bridge and Greenways) is appropriate this time.</FONT></P>

reported on attending the community briefing on Tuesday, February
17</FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">th</FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">,
concerning Neighborcare Health’s new Meridian Center for Health. 
The health center will be located at North 105</FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">th</FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">
Street and Meridian Avenue North.  It will be built on site owned by
King County and will have a 50 year ground lease.  This will be the
biggest structure Neighborcare Health has ever built and will cost
$2.5 million.  It will be a “green” building.  They already treat
800,000 people and are bigger than Group Health in Seattle.  This new
health center will offer care for anyone who comes through their
doors.  They are partnering with the Public Health Department, WIC
(maternity support), and Valley City (mental health; substance
abuse).  They now have 24 clinics/school based health centers in
Seattle.  Meridian Center for Health will be a “one stop campus for
health.”  They will offer low-income families a health care home
with:  primary medical and dental care; specialty mental health and
recovery services; WIC nutrition and maternity support services; and
additional human services, to be included over time, to meet
“evolving patient needs.”  </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><U>Aurora-Licton
Pedestrian Zone Legislation</U></FONT><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">.
 Tom Meyer informed us about the new pedestrian zones with businesses
oriented toward the public.  Existing businesses will be
grandfathered in unless they have been vacant for an extended time
period, and new businesses will be under the new requirements, which
include no parking between the buildings and the street, and having
shops and restaurants on the first floor, etc.  The Aurora Merchants
are not in favor of some of this legislation.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><U>Proposed
Hotel</U></FONT><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">.  A five story, 65
feet high hotel is proposed for the location where Arby’s presently
exists.  The plans are for the hotel to be from lot line to lot line
with two levels of underground parking.  DPD is ready to permit. 
Discussion followed.  The SEPA period has closed.  The project has
been in permitting a long time.  It seems inappropriate.  There is so
much ground water in this area.  Having a building take up a complete
lot with no open space around it, is not appropriate and hasn’t
been allowed in the City for a location like this before.</FONT></P>
