<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The meeting was

  The meeting minutes from April 19, 2000 were approved as presented.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TREASURERS REPORT:  

  Jerry Owens, acting treasurer, gave a verbal report that two (2) checks have 

  been written this month one for $76.63, postage for the May newsletter and one

  Parks Department.</span></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LICTON SPRINGS 

  PARK:  Sandy Bell said the Licton Springs Park comfort station is scheduled 

  to be replaced.  It is the Parks Department’s #1 priority in the North End and 

  at top of the CAP Improvements Projects Budget.  The budget must be approved 

  by the Seattle City Council.  The open design process should begin in 2001, 

  with building in 2002.  Comments were made about the improved traffic since 

  the sanican was installed.  Randy is keeping the Seattle Police Department North 

  Division informed of our problem.  There was discussion of self-cleaning bathrooms.  

  SPU (Seattle Public Utilities) has funds for six, with five downtown, and one 

  possibly located in Ballard.  Bob asked about the possibility of locating a 

  wall Kiosk on the new comfort station.  Sandy said that there are Park Department 

  standards for Kiosks.  She said the interior grass at Licton Springs Park is 

  not being cut because SPU has asked the Parks Department not to cut that grass 

  during the Densmore Drainage Basin Study.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">VOTING:  The motion 

  made at our last meeting was voted down unanimously.  A motion was made, seconded 

  and passed to accept the LSCC Board positions as follows:</font></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President

             Ellen Beck<br>

  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Treasurer            

             Randy Elder</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EIF:  Bob Messina 

  made a motion to dissolve the current EIF Stewardship Committee of Jan Brucker, 

  Jerry Owens and Sheryl Stich with many thanks for their good work, with the 

  LSCC Board taking full responsibility for this stewardship.  John seconded the 

  motion.  During discussion, it was decided we would wait to vote until our June 

  meeting.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDGET:  Wanda 

  presented a proposed budget for 2000/2001.  Some corrections were made.  The 

  Board accepted the new amended budget.  Copies will be available at our June 

  meeting.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MICROSOFT STOCK:  

  A motion was made, seconded and passed to use the Microsoft funds to pay for 

  the Licton Springs Park sanican.  A letter was presented from Christopher Williams 

  (Seattle Parks Department NW Manager) stating the cost of $70.00 per month for 

  the sanican.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RPZ:  Signs are 

  up.  Zone folks should send for their stickers now.  Debra said the signs do 

  not mention holidays but she was told holidays are excluded by default and that 

  patrols will be regular soon.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">POLICE:  Randy 

  has asked the NSP if Licton Springs neighbors can collect license plate numbers 

  and/or flyer illegally parked cars; the official opinion is coming.  Car crime 

  is up in Licton Springs.  Randy and Phil Fujii suggested we invite Judy Nicastro 

  (Seattle City Council Member) to a Licton Springs walking tour soon.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HISTORICAL PROJECT:  

  Phil had information concerning non-profits and suggested a history committee.  

  He will provide a list of people who could help us.  Jan said she would accept 

  historical papers from neighbors.  She would like to interview Brewster Denny.  

  Lakeside School is doing a history of this area.  The Broadview Community has 

  done a history book, which includes part of Licton Springs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIOSK:  Bob presented 

  information on an outdoor, cabinet style, wall mounted, metal with acrylic window 

  and lock Kiosk.  A 3'X3' Kiosk costs $465.00 plus tax and installation.  The 

  acrylic is replaceable and Bob will find out how much that would cost.  Much 

  discussion followed about size and placement.  We will continue to discuss this 

  by e-mail and at our next meeting.</font></p>
