 Monty Monterecy gave us an update on NSCC.  He has three different
titles because of cutbacks on staffing:  Vice President of
Administrative Services, Director of Facilities and Operations and
Capital Projects Manager NSCC.  Monty told us that he has been
working on smaller projects that improve the impression a person gets
when first coming to North.  On the weekends they have been power
washing the buildings and having a sealer put on them.  They have had
the public restrooms professionally cleaned and sanitized so that the
staff will have an easier time of cleaning them.  They are also
modernizing the public restrooms, as resources allow.  They have
re-cabbed the elevators to modernize them, and are refurbishing
classrooms.  The tree canopy has been raised, pathways improved, and
flower pots with plants that will provide color all year round, all
improve the campus.  Monty calls these improvements “little bites.”
 His goal is to use bits of funding when they are available to make
updates and improvements to North.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Monty
has delegated and given responsibility to staff members for certain
areas.  Putting staff in charge of areas gives them pride in what
they are doing for North.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">He
reported on the renovation work for the Technology Building.  The
work there will begin this summer and provide 370 jobs and cost $26
million.  It will create a center for the campus.  There will be a
new cafeteria and student gathering spaces on the ground level. 
Those areas will have the ability to open up to the outdoors during
good weather.  It will be a “village green” and gathering place.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">New
electronic signs have been approved.  They will replace the 1960’s
signs that really need to be modernized.  The present signs need to
be hand lettered and some interesting messages have occurred in the
past.  Electronic signs will save man hours and allow for messages to
be easily changed.  The plan is that the new signs would be scaled to
be readable from the sidewalk and the street.  The ordinance that
allows the electronic signs does not limit use, but Monty said he
will coordinate with the community and the signs would not have to be
on 24/7.  The hope is for the new signs to be installed this year.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Monty
said that it’s a challenging environment now, but NSCC has good
people, nice people, who do a good job!  He will attend our meetings
as the NSCC representative as often as he’s able.  He told us that
he was born in Cuba and moved to the U.S. with his parents when
Castro was going to take power.</FONT></P>

discussion about Oxbow Farm, which followed up on an email sent to
meeting attendees.  Monty said that the College had assessed Oxbow
Farm and okayed them.  It was noted that Jan had raised concern in
the e-mail string that LSCC shouldn’t endorse one entity over
others.  Discussion followed.  It was determined that the List Serve
was not the vehicle for mentioning Oxbow Farm.  Kay said that she
would do research on the web and give information on farm produce
availability (including Oxbow Farm) in the same format that she gives
information about farmers’ markets in the </FONT><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><I>E-Currents</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">.</FONT></P>

is involved with his Union at work and is now an officer and involved
in negotiating.  He said it would be great if someone else could be
the primary person to attend these meetings and he would be happy to

searched for permitting in connection with the Blanchet lights and
nothing appeared.  This made him think that he needed to do more

discussion.  Liz said she would give copies of the Amended Articles
and Conflict of Interest Policy (once she received them from Ellen),
and the red-lined version of the Bylaws to all directors.  She would
like us to complete our amendment of the Bylaws so that this project
does not fall to Jan.  So come ready to discuss Bylaws at our May
