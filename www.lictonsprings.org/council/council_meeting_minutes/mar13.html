at Wilson Pacific</U></FONT><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">.  This
is the time to do something.  Andrew Morrison was working with the
School District, but he says he was “disrespected” and he is no
longer talking with them.  Liz suggested that perhaps Jan could speak
with Andrew.  It would be nice to find out what kind of hurtles exist
and perhaps mend ways.  </FONT>

questioned whether or not there was an “art person” at the School

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Jan
questioned how we were doing with dues/money.  Kay Mesirow said she
would talk to Debra about setting us up on PayPal.  Most people now
are very used to making payments online.  Jan said that she thought
there was a way to set it up so that money went directly into the
LSCC bank account.  Kay said that our fee for PayPal services would
be less because we are a nonprofit.</FONT></P>

had attended the recent transit meeting and been quite vocal about
pedestrian issues.  “What kind of public safety don’t you
understand?”  She said she thought LSCC should send a letter on
this issue.  Jan asked Melanie initially to draft something up since
she was the one at the meeting.  Melanie agreed to do so.  It was
suggested “pitching” that money is well spent on safety when
money is sparse.</FONT></P>
