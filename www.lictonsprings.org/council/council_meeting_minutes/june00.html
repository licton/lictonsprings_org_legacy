      <p><u><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Present</font></u><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">:  

        Liz Kearns, Jerry Owens, Randy Elder, Bob Messina, Wanda Fullner, Bethany 

        Ryals, Edie Whitsett, Wally Fosmore, Pam Larsen, and Ellen Beck.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Absent</u>:  

        Jan Brucker, John Meerscheidt, Debra Willendorf, and Sheryl Stich.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Visitors</u>:  

        Nancy Sharp, Ken Thompson, Ann Patterson, Jean Wirch, Harold Schmidt, 

        Lindsey Packwood, Guillemette Regan, Gil Schieber, Elizabeth Nucci, David 

        Hemmelgarn (Seattle Executive Services Department, Real Estate Services, 

        Strategic Planner), Jan Avinger-Jacques, Evelyn Lemon, Jana Christensen, 

        John Laboritz, and Jodell Gillig.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President 

        Liz Kearns called the meeting to order at 7:09 p.m., and those present 

        introduced themselves.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>Minutes</u>:  

        </b>The May 17, 2000 meeting minutes were amended to correct the spelling 

        of Brewster Denny’s name, and then approved as corrected.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>Treasurer’s 

        Report</u></b>:  Randy Elder stated that because the change-over had not 

        been completed as yet, there would be no Treasurer’s Report.  Wanda Fullner 

        did provide copies of the 2000/2001 Budget approved at last month’s meeting.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>Densmore 

        Drainage Study.</u>:  </b>Liz next turned the meeting over to Pam Miller, 

        who is a Senior Project Manager, Project Management, Seattle Public Utilities, 

        and is in charge of the Densmore Drainage Study.  Pam told us that R.W. 

        Beck had been hired by SPU to perform the study, which is currently being 

        done.  She said that R.W. Beck would come up with a set of recommendations 

        and that presentations would be made to the community and community input 

        would be considered.  The final recommenda­tions will then be developed 

        into a plan that will be presented to the City Council.  The timing is 

        (i) for the presentations to the community to happen in September, 2000, 

        and (ii) for the full recommendation to be completed in November, 2000.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pam Miller 

        had various maps and charts and described for the meeting attendees the 

        job of Seattle Public Utilities.  She said that drainage studies were 

        being done in order to develop solutions for the City as a whole.  The 

        studies take time because of the monitoring that is necessary.  She said 

        that the goal was for the City to be able to experience a 25-year storm 

        without damage.  The City can also experience 100-year storms, but the 

        goal is not to gauge preparedness on such storms, but rather what is categorized 

        as a 25-year storm.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pam Miller 

        was asked about when work could be expected to take place in Licton Springs 

        Park.  She said that her best guess was that that work was four to five 

        years down the line.  She said that people could call her with questions 

        (684-5179) or could e&#8209;mail her at <a

href="mailto:pamela.miller@ci.seattle.wa.us">pamela.miller@ci.seattle.wa.us</a>.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Based on 

        Ms. Miller’s estimated timing for Licton Springs Park, Wanda Fullner made 

        a motion that the Licton Springs Community Council lobby the Parks Department 

        to immediately go forward with reconstruction of the bridges in Licton 

        Springs Park.  This motion was seconded and unanimously passed.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>Community 

        Plan Implementation</u>: </b> David Hemmelgarn (684-0701), who is with 

        the City of Seattle Executive Department, Real Estate Services, reported 

        to us that his department was surveying properties owned by the City and 

        not currently in use and would be reporting back to the City in the near 

        future.  He said that the recommenda­tions would be made in July.  He 

        said he could inform us that the Kelm House had been sold at auction by 

        Murphy’s.  Harold Schmidt confirmed that it had been sold for $8,250.00 

        and he also questioned if proper notice had been given for the auction.  

        Harold said that it had not been very well publicized.  Edie Whitsett 

        said that removal of the Kelm House could take up to eight months because 

        of required permits, etc. needing to be first obtained by the buyer.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">David told 

        us about City Light’s plans to expand employee parking spaces.  He said 

        that City Light has approximately 385 employees and currently 192 parking 

        spaces in Areas A, B, and D, plus some senior management parking spaces 

        not in the designated areas.  He said that in 2002, 90 additional parking 

        spaces will be added in Area C, presently a storage yard.  He passed out 

        copies of City Light’s site plan showing these areas.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">David passed 

        out copies of a photo showing property ownership in the proposed redevelopment 

        area (Aurora Avenue Neighborhood Commercial District – area between Aurora 

        and Stone Avenue and North 100<sup>th</sup> and North 97<sup>th</sup> 

        Streets).  He mentioned that our Plan discussed development of mixed use 

        in the area shown.  He stressed that the “committee” should give the City 

        good advance notice of requested zoning changes and/or other changes for 

        this area, and he said that he can be of assistance to us in this regard.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">David said 

        that the City Light substation was going to be surplused and sold.  A 

        short discussion was had.  He mentioned that neighbors on the street had 

        been in favor of selling the lot to Habitat for Humanity, but that the 

        property would be put to bid.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Randy Elder 

        passed out copies of <i>Licton Springs Magazine</i>.  He suggested that 

        perhaps we could sell these magazines to raise money for the Council.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>EIF</u>:  

        </b>Liz next gave a summary of Licton Springs EIF proposals and the areas 

        in which early implementation funds had already been expended:  (1) outreach 

        (producing the community’s newsletter for one year, updating our mailing 

        list); (2) kiosks (one has been ordered for Licton Springs Park); (3) 

        historical project; and (4) North Park.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Liz spoke 

        about the historical project component.  Our neighborhood has a rich history 

        going back to Native American times and the early history of Seattle.  

        She announced that the Historical Committee will be meeting Monday, June&nbsp;26, 

        2000, at 7:00 p.m. in the President’s Board Room at NSCC.  Everyone was 

        welcome to participate.  Liz noted that a consultant would be hired to 

        assist in the creation of a pamphlet or small book.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Edie Whitsett 

        next spoke about the North Park Project.  She described the “park” between 

        105<sup>th</sup> and 107<sup>th</sup> with Northgate Way bordering on 

        the north, and the property line with the Park Meridian Condominiums on 

        the south.  She said the park had been used by Disc Golf players for ten 

        years and that members who played there had done the bulk of the maintenance 

        work.  Edie said that a Park Committee had been formed and the landscape 

        architectural firm of Anderson &amp; Ray had been chosen to assist the 

        Committee in planning for the improvements for North Park.  She said that 

        one Park workshop had already been held on Saturday, June&nbsp;3<sup>rd</sup>.  

        She urged anyone interested to come to the next workshop, Wednesday, June 

        28, 2000, 7:00&nbsp;p.m. in the NSCC Rose Room.  She said that the architects 

        would have three concept plans for the group to consider and offer suggestions 

        and responses.  Edie had one of the preliminary concept plans to illustrate 

        what could be expected.  She also passed out North Seattle “Disc Golf” 

        Park Surveys and a flyer on Park News.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Those in 

        attendance broke into discussion groups and the meeting was adjourned 

        at 8:46 p.m.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Respectfully
