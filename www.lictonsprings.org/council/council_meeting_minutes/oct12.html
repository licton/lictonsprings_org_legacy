Springs Next Door</U></FONT><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">.  Stu
Ling made a presentation and invited all to join Licton Springs Next
Door.  He said it was a private neighborhood organization for
everyone living within the Licton Springs neighborhood, with borders
roughly approximating our official borders.  You can go to
<A HREF="https://lictonsprings.nextdoor.com/join">https://lictonsprings.nextdoor.com/join</A>
to get the instructions on how to join (which consists of proving you
live within the borders).  The company owning the website is a
for-profit San Francisco company.  Anyone who has joined can seek
neighborhood folks with similar interests by forming “groups.” 
Stu is interested in the aggressive raccoons in the neighborhood and
has formed a “raccoons” group.  Liz Kearns has joined and Stu
created a “recipe” group that Liz was interest in.  Whatever your
interest, you can form a group and see if others will join in your
concerns, i.e., “crime and safety,” “cycling.”</FONT></P>

The first Community Book Exchange held at Licton Springs Park
September 29, 2012.  The intent of the book exchange was to “build

earned $38.00.</FONT></P>

Lights and Loudspeakers</U></FONT><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">. 
Tom Meyer commented about the Blanchet lights and loudspeakers.  A
complaint was filed on September 9</FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">th</FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">
with the City charging that “Blanchet’s stadium appears not to
conform to stipulations in its last permit issued in 2006, and
appears to be in violation of Seattle’s noise regulations.”  The
complaint asks the City to investigate.  Jerry said that he hears
play-by-play in his house with the windows closed.  He can also hear
the crowd noise.  Everything is amplified.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Eric
Johnston arrived to fill us in.  He said that Blanchet is now
planning on 70 foot towers of light and enhanced sound system.  He
noted also the parking problems associated with game nights.  He said
it was very troublesome that what Blanchet was applying for had
changed over time.  Initially it was five to six night games.  Now,
it is games six days a week.  The school claims that the lights will
be partially shielded.  The school every early on was granted a
determination of non-significance in regards to environmental impact,
but then their overall project changed.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Eric
feels there is a lot of interest and concern about what is happening,
but doesn’t feel enough will get done.   He worries that the trend
is for high schools to have lit fields and he is concerned that other
communities will be similarly impacted, while this project could be
setting precedence.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Kathleen
Braden asked if there had been any focus on the night birds at Green
Lake and the impact of the night lighting on them.  It was suggested
that Sierra Club and other similar groups need to receive outreach.</FONT></P>

already exist.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Eric
feels certain that there have been engineering and lighting since
BBHS made their plan and BBHS is not using state of the art lights. 
Multiple lower lights would be less impactful.  Amplifying the sound
is huge as is the impact on night skies.  He said that with the loss
of Memorial Stadium, the City needs another stadium and wonders if
perhaps this could be at Seattle Center (Key Arena).</FONT></P>
