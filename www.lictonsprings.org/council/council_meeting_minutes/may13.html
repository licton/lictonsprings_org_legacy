Transit</U></FONT><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">.  Sound Transit
has funding and plans to go from the University District, to
Roosevelt, and to Northgate.  The Northgate Link project was
baselined in June 2012  and $10 million  contribution has been
committed for the I-5 pedestrian bridge and other pedestrian and bike
improvements.  This contribution has been matched by the City of
Seattle.  Right now there is a shortfall in the City’s portion for
the cost of the pedestrian bridge.  The City has until 2015 to find
the money to remedy the shortfall, or the funds go back into
non-motorized access.  Sound Transit would then do a study to
identify where to invest the funds.</FONT></P>
