        the 

        North 

        End 

        have 

        now 

        been 

        reduced 

        to 

        three 

        managers.  

        The 

        staffing 

        cuts 

        in 

        the 

        Department 

        of 

        Neighborhoods 

        have 

        been 

        from 

        30% 

        to 

        50%.  

        The 

        CNC 

        has 

        been 

        formed 

        to 

        help 

        the 

        DON.  

        There 

        will 

        be 

        no 

        money 

        for 

        property 

        acquisition 

        for 

        the 

        next 

        couple 

        of 

        years.  

        Small 

        and 

        Simple 

        grants 

        are 

        still 

        available, 

        but 

        $100,000.00 

        is 

        the 

        maximum 

        dollar 

        amount 

        available.  

        Wanda 

        said 

        that 

        the 

        co-chairs 

        (whose 

        names 

        she 

        can’t 

        recall) 

        are 

        very 

        knowledgeable 

        and 

        know 

        the 

        City.  

        Representatives 

        to 

        the 

        CNC 

        come 

        from 

        all 

        over 

        the 

        City.  

        Jerry 

        and 

        Wanda 

        volunteered 

        to 

        represent 

        us 

        on 

        the 

        Council.  

        Thank 

        you 

        so 

        much, 

        Jerry 

        and
