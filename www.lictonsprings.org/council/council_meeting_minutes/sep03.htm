        <p class=MsoHeader align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Halloween 

          in the Park</u>:  Liz reported that Betsy Weill will once again coordinate 

          this event.  Betsy will use the donation pot to raise money to pay the 

          musicians playing for the event.  She has some cash remaining from last 

          year.  Debra said that LSCC had received a $25.00 donation for Halloween 

          in the Park and that Betsy would receive that money.  We will do a flyer 

          for Halloween and hope that lots of children come to the event.</font></p>

        <p class=MsoHeader align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Picnic</u>:  

          A discussion was had regarding this year’s picnic.  Liz said that the 

          musicians, although good, were not cooperative about playing music to 

          equal one hour.  They set the time they would play and if the music 

          was interrupted, they did not give us back that time in music.  It was 

          decided to investigate other music possibilities for next year.  Last 

          year a couple of madrigals walked around and sang at the Halloween event.  

          Perhaps that type of entertainment might work for the picnic.  We also 

          can contact Julie Howe Gwinn, who manages Sandel Park about the groups 

          that had performed there this summer.  It was noted that Sandel Park 

          has concerts and we want concert/background music, so not every group 

          would be appropriate for us.  It was also suggested that Betsy Weill 

          might have some information on groups we could contact.</font></p>

        <p class=MsoHeader align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 

          was suggested that next year we should consider having a balloon man, 

          instead of the Bubbleman.  There was agreement on this.</font></p>

        <p class=MsoHeader align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Liz 

          reported that we had napkins and forks left over for use next year.</font></p>

        <p class=MsoHeader align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Liz 

          had been told that Beth Snow, the manager of Oak Tree, had asked Starbucks, 

          Larry’s, and the UPS Store how she could help the community.  Liz said 

          that she would contact Ms. Snow regarding what she was most interested 

          in and what type of support she was thinking of offering.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Pilling’s 

          Pond</u>:  Wanda Fullner reported that the committee is now working 

          on a fence easement, a new method of preserving the pond and view.  The 

          public or a nonprofit would have rights over the fence, and the pond 

          and view would be preserved.  The goal is to structure the arrangement 

          in a way to get additional funding for educational and historical aspects 

          of the pond.  An appraisal is needed to show how much value is lost 

          to the property because of the fence.  Then, that money would be paid 

          to the Pilling family.  A consultant will develop the educational programming.  

          The committee has been told that they have a $20,000.00 grant (King 

          County funds) to pay for the easement, but Wanda says that she will 

          not be assured that those funds will be received until they, in fact, 

          are received.  The committee is very excited at perhaps being on the 

          verge of preservation of the pond.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also, 

          Wanda told us that Yvonne’s sister and her sister’s husband have moved 

          into the Pilling’s house by the pond.  A lot of work has been done on 

          the house and the sister is very enthusiastic about preserving the pond.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>City 

          Neighborhood Council</u>:  A discussion was had concerning the City 

          Neighborhood District, which is a coming together of representatives 

          from the 13 districts that make up the City.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Seattle 

          Community Council Federation</u>:  The Federation has a long history 

          of activism and they focus on issues at their meetings.  They meet at 

          NOAA.  The Federation predates the Department of Neighborhoods and is 

          not sanctioned by the City.  Licton Springs Community Council is a member 

          of the Federation and it is through our membership that we have access 

          to 501(c) status.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Northwest 

          District Council</u>:  Ted Pickett volunteered to attend the Northwest 

          District Council meeting next Wednesday.  He will report on our neighborhood 

          and bring back news of the other neighborhoods.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>History 

          House</u>:  Wanda volunteered to get together an exhibit from our community 

          to be displayed at History House in November and December.  Thank you, 

          Wanda!  Beth Pflug told us that History House is a nonprofit group that 

          promotes neighborhood councils.  This fall History House will be featuring 

          the northern neighborhoods and want to have displays about their history.  

          Discussion followed.  Wanda said that the Pilling’s Pond video would 

          be displayed (using constant replay), as well as photographs, including 

          a photograph of the mural of Chief Seattle.  The display that is created 

          must be at History House by October 15<sup>th</sup>, and will be returned 

          to the community in January.  We can then make use of it as part of 

          our permanent collection for other community purposes.</font></p>
