              Sidewalks &#8211; 100th. Trung Pham reported that the present plan 

              was to put two blocks of alternative sidewalks on the south side 

              of 100th from Ashworth to Densmore. The budget for the project is 

              $40,000.00. Mr. Pham said this is a detention area with no existing 

              storm drain system. SPU has not as yet approved the plan. Discussion 

              followed. The sidewalk would be asphalt on top of one foot of gravel 

              with air pockets. A neighbor on 100th has contacted the City and 

              a traffic study will be done. The City budget picture is glum and 

              looks to be worst in 2005. It was stated that it is dangerous for 

              pedestrians walking on 100th. Everyone wished that this could be 

              addressed. Mr. Pham said there were many problems on the north side 

              of 100th, including encroaching fences and drainage problems. He 

              said that there could perhaps be enough funding for three blocks 

              of sidewalks. Discussion centered on the first two blocks from College 

              Way. Mr. Pham said that perhaps it would be possible to do two blocks 

              of sidewalks plus a walking lane on the south side down to College 

              Way. Jerry said he could appreciate that this was not the ideal 

              solution, but with budget constraints he was in favor of going ahead. 

              Mr. Pham told us that the City Sidewalk Fund was in its last year. 

              In 2005 a Local Improvement District Sidewalk Project will be put 

              in place. He said the 100th project would be completed this summer, 

              if the project was okayed.</font></st1:PlaceName></st1:place></p>

              Jerry gave a recap of the stakeholders&#8217; meetings and the plans 

              for the south lot. It will be mixed use &#8211; commercial and residential. 

              There are three proposals for daylighting Thornton Creek: (1) natural 

              (more or less a swale &#8211; water not present at all times); (2) 

              daylighting with an 18 foot depth; (3) hybrid proposal &#8211; daylighting 

              plus natural drainage, with a depth of 12 feet. The hybrid proposal 

              is getting the most support. The next stakeholders&#8217; meeting 

              is May 20th, and after that a meeting is planned for after Memorial 

              Day on June 3rd. Jerry and Shannon said a lot of material still 

              needs to be covered, including traffic and the mall proper.</font></p>

              to pay for Mrs. Pilling&#8217;s care. Melanie has been very impressed 

              with all the interest shown in the pond. A volunteer from the University
