<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Cheryl
next gave us information about the North Precinct wetlands.  The goal
is to help protect the Precinct wetland.  She told us that there was
a meeting about the North Precinct wetland last May where Dr. Sarah
Cooke gave a presentation to explain what has happening and give the
latest updates.  The wetlands there are part of the head waters of
Thornton Creek.  SPU tried to control the water flow.  Chris May from
SPU had installed a weir five to seven years ago, eliminating the old
control system.  He left SPU in the latest budget crunch.  </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Three
meetings back Dr. Cooke reported that someone had punched a hole in
the weir, so water drained out of the pond.  Cheryl said that
everything was taken out of the pond.  A new planting Plan was
presented to Fleets and Facilities.  Thornton Creek Alliance was also
present at the meeting.  The weir was repaired by SPU.  Cheryl
requested a meeting with Finance Administration’s Nancy
Bloss-Stacey.   Cheryl was in favor of replanting with native plants.
 Nancy Bloss-Stacey was open to that.  They were open to volunteers
working at the wetlands, but there were security issues.</FONT></P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">At
a subsequent meeting attended by Nancy, Cheryl, and SPI, more ideas
about types of plants were discussed.  In the end, some plants were
taken from Cheryl’s plan and some from SPU’s plan.  Setting a
work party still had clearance issues.  It was decided that the best
time to plant was in the fall.  </FONT>
