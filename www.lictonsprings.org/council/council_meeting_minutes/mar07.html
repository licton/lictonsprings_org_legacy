                    Report:</b> There was no Treasurer&rsquo;s

                Report, but Debra Willendorf reported that every Newsletter that

                number of memberships and membership renewals has been dropping.

                For example, Debra pointed out that where in the past 20 people

                sent membership dues after receiving a Newsletter, she now receives

              only six. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Community Court Program</b> Stephanie

                  Tschida, of the Community Court Program, explained what the

                  program does. She explained that she was with the City Attorney&rsquo;s Office and now works

                with the Community Court Program. This program screens people

                guilty of misdemeanors and small crimes (i.e., sleeping in a

                park, prostitution, theft &ndash; survival crimes) and offers

                those who qualify the opportunity to go to Community Court and

                be sentenced to community service, hopefully in the same communities

                where their violations occurred. The program began has a test

                program and now is being put into effect citywide. Diversion

                offenders are individuals who function at a high level. The number

                of hours of community service that offenders are sentenced is

                based on recommended sentencing. A 10-day sentence would equal

              32 hours; first-timers are sentenced to eight hours. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Community

                Court Program seeks to create relationships with communities

                and Stephanie and Julie Taylor asked whether we would/could participate.

                Liz mentioned and spoke about GAIN (Greenwood-Aurora Involved

                Neighbors) as another possible group for the Community Court

                Program to partner with. In our community, help is always welcome

              at the monthly work parties at Licton Springs Park. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Other areas

                where help could be used are: mowing the shoulder/parking strip

                along both sides of 85th from the freeway onramp/exit ramp down

                the hill to Wallingford; the planting strip in front of North

                Seattle Community College; and along the sidewalk on the west

                side of Wallingford Avenue North between 92nd Avenue North and

              90th Avenue North (alongside the playing field). </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Community

                Court Program seeks to be a holistic and comprehensive treatment

                program for first-time or qualified offenders that allows them

              to give back to the communities they harmed. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Wilson-Pacific Update</b> Liz gave an update on Wilson-Pacific

                School, which the Council has always wanted it to be a middle

                school. The Indian Heritage School is still at Wilson and has

                65 students. Home School Resources office is also there. The

                School District parks vehicles and landscaping materials there,

                as well. With Amy Markishtum present she was able to give additional

                information since she works for the School District. The new

                School District facility does not have room for all District

              departments and personnel.</font></p>

              <p align="left"> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Director

                  of Wilson-Pacific Facilities, Courtney Jones, has told Liz

                  that there are no plans to alter the use of Wilson-Pacific.

                  Liz pointed out that an article in today&rsquo;s

                paper listed potential schools for closure, but did not mention

              Wilson-Pacific. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Liz reported that she had been contacted by a

                group of concerned citizens in the Viewlands Elementary neighborhood.

                That group has inquired whether a Licton Springs Wilson-Pacific

                group would like to join their task force and combine efforts

              for both schools. Discussion followed. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Liz said that if anyone

                was interested in contacting the Viewlands task force, they should

              do so.</font></p>

              <p align="left"> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Board Elections </b>Jerry

                  Owens, Kay Mesirow, and Debra Willendorf&rsquo;s

                terms are completed this year. Liz said she had asked Jerry if

                he was willing to serve another term and he had said he was happy

                to proceed. She asked Kay and Debra if they were willing to serve

                another term and they both said yes. Thank you to all of you! </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A discussion followed about serving as a director.

              Tom Meyer agreed to serve! Thank you and WELCOME, Tom.</font></p>

              <p align="left"> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Future Meetings</b> Kay suggested that the

                Council should have &quot;crime

                in the neighborhood&quot; meetings twice a year with cooperation

              from the North Precinct. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Debra said that we needed to discuss

              having an on-line Newsletter in addition to our paper Newsletter.</font></p>

              <p align="left"> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kathleen

                  Braden asked about adding directions and/or a map to the List

                  Serve to help new attendees find the President&rsquo;s

              Board Room. It was agreed that was a great idea. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Crime Stats</b>

                Ken Thompson said that crime statistics were available at the

                North Precinct Advisory Council meetings, which are held the

              first Wednesday of the month. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bob Ferguson Meeting. It was announced
