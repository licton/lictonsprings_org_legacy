        <p align="left" class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:.5in'><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">100th 

          Sidewalk. Liz reported that Trung Phan is on vacation until February 

          22, 2005.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><u>Speed 

          Bumps.</u></strong> Liz reported that she had spoken with Theresa Smith. 

          The process to get speed bumps involves: (1) getting information with 

          a radar gun; (2) having the information put into a database; (3) having 

          a radar trailer in place to flash speed to motorists; and (4) having 

          traffic study tubes to record volume and speed of traffic.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is also 

          possible to slow traffic by having parking on both sides of the street. 

          Speed bumps are expensive and hard to qualify for receiving.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><u>Newsletter.</u></strong> 

          Liz said that there was some confusion with Bob Ferguson&#8217;s office 

          regarding paying for our newsletter. They apparently wanted to approve 

          the newsletter before it was mailed out. However, they did offer to 

          pay for the newsletter and another in June. Normally his office pays 

          for either the postage OR the printing, not both. But he has made an 

          exception for us, since we won&#8217;t have another newsletter until 

          August, too late for his June deadline. We very much appreciate Bob&#8217;s 

          support (meeting with neighbors at Starbucks on 2/11 and attending our 

          community meeting on 2/16, plus covering the cost of our January newsletter).</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><u>List 

          Serve.</u></strong><u> </u>Shannon Snider reported that he would show 

          someone how to add e mail addresses to the list serve, or if the addresses 

          were given to him, he would add them. Debra said that she would forward 

          the information to Shannon and he could be the one to add them to the 

          list serve.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><u>Senate 

          Bill 5160.</u></strong> Community member John Mark spoke about the dangers 

          of cell phone usage while driving. He had written materials which he 

          passed out. This has been a concern of his for a number of years.</font></p>

        <p align="left" class=MsoNormal><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><u>Northgate 

          Library.</u> </strong>Ellen Beck gave an update on the Northgate Community 

          Center and Library per an e-mail from The Seattle Public Library. The 

          City is moving forward with the contract award for this project! Construction 

          is expected to begin in March 2005 with the facilities to open in late 

          spring 2006.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><u>North 

          Precinct.</u></strong><u> </u>Ellen asked what the consensus was for 

          putting the North Precinct Report on our website. Everyone was in favor 

          of this. Liz said she had talked to Amy Markistum, who maintains our 

          website, regarding whether she could add the Report to the Licton Springs 

          Community website and the answer was yes!</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><u>Bob 

          Ferguson.</u></strong> Bob Ferguson, King County Councilmember for District 

          2, next introduced himself and informed us of recent events, as well 

          as answered questions. He said that with the reduction of districts 

          from 13 to nine, new lines have been drawn. Even though he just won 

          election to the Council, he will have to run in the next election to 

          retain his seat. Our district will include North Seattle, Shoreline, 

          Lake Forest Park, Bothell, Kenmore, Woodinville, and parts of unincorporated 

          King County.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There was 

          a long question and answer session on the recent elections and provisional 

          ballots and election reform.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mr. Ferguson 

          also answered questions about the Critical Area Ordinance.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><u>95th 

          and Ashworth Open Right-of-Way.</u></strong> Liz reported that around 

          Christmas time the pathway from Ashworth to Interlake, that Bob Messina 

          and a group of volunteers cleared and beautified earlier, had been damaged 

          when a truck drove through the pathway, presumably as a shortcut. Liz 

          reported that she talked with the construction workers there on Ashworth, 

          and they had assisted in restoring the pathway. Liz said she would contact 

          Kirsten Sparkman and inquire if there was any possibility of getting 

          some big rocks to protect the right-of-way path.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><u>Neighborhood 

          Appreciation Day.</u></strong> Wanda Fullner reported that she and Liz 

          had gone to the Neighborhood Appreciation Day at the Phinney Neighborhood 

          Association. She said that the Phinney group had gotten a $100,000.00 

          grant to get into their building. They had demonstrated a need for space 

          and had found partners in the community to join with them.</font></p>
