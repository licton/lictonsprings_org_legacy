          NSCC Conference Room B2311</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

          Directors Present: <br>

          Jerry Owens, Debra Willendorf, Tom Meyer, Kay Mesirow, and Ellen Beck.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Board Representatives Present: <br>

          Ken Thompson (Liaison to North Precinct).</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Visitors: <br>

          Jean Wirch, Daniel Daly, Cathy Pfeiffer, Margaret Mocho, Robin McCain, Ron Hornung, Allan Kutoff, Josh Freedman, Thomas Whittemore (Department of Neighbor-hoods), and Mike Cuadra.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Vice President Jerry Owens called the meeting to order at 7:05 p.m. We had introductions around the table. All the new visitors were warmly welcomed.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Minutes<br>

          The September 15, 2010, and January 19, 2011 minutes were approved as presented. The November 17, 2010 minutes were approved after amending the author to Jerry Owens.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Treasurer&rsquo;s Report<br>

          Debra Willendorf presented Treasurer&rsquo;s Reports for January 1, 2010 through December, 2010, and for January, 2011. Copies were distributed. Discussion followed. The decline of the paying of dues was noted. It was suggested that perhaps the decline in paying dues followed the stopping of mailing out hard copies of the Currents and instead going on line with it. Being able to pay dues on line (the Licton Springs website) and on Facebook was discussed.After more discussion, Jerry moved to accept the Treasurer&rsquo;s Reports, Kay Mesirow seconded the motion, and it passed unanimously.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW BUSINESS:</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Neighborhood Advisory Group<br>

          Josh Freedman talked to us about the Neighborhood Advisory Group that he is a member of. He said he was solicited to join the group after taking part in the discussion regarding the proposed strip club at the site of Cyndy&rsquo;s House of Pancakes on Aurora Avenue North. He told us the urban villages plans are being updated and the neighborhoods around the urban villages are being engaged to participate.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thomas Whittemore joined the conversation. He works for the Department of Neighborhoods and is assigned to the northern area, which includes Licton Springs. He explained that the Advisory Group is setting priorities, so it is very important to get people to the meetings to participate. There are drainage issues. On Linden Avenue there are a number of senior residents. From 130th to 145th, there are no sidewalks. More services are needed.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He noted that there was an extensive article on transportation and neighborhoods in the Pacific Magazine on Sunday.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This summer repaving will be done on 85th!</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">P-Patch at NSCC<br>

          The P-Patch at NSCC was discussed. It is conceptual at this point. Christian Rusby is the NSCC Sustainability Coordinator and has been working on locating a P Patch at the College. He came and spoke at our January meeting. Kay said he had asked her to send an e-mail to Carol Summers, the College&rsquo;s Public Relations contact stating support for the P-Patch on campus. She has done so. Ellen Beck reported that she had written a letter of support on behalf of the Community Council that Christian had requested. Ellen had followed up with Christian and he indicated the letter was perfect. He said he would be scheduling a meeting in the next two weeks, and will soon be in touch with us.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fruit Harvesting<br>

          It was noted that there has been an effort to get a program going to harvest fruit in the neighborhoods. The owners of the trees would receive some of the fruit and food banks could receive fresh fruit.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">501(c)(3) Status Report<br>

          </font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ellen reported she had followed up with the Internal Revenue agent assigned to our application. He had faxed the &ldquo;501(c)(3) Provisions&rdquo; not enclosed with his last letter that need to be adopted in our Articles. Ellen had e-mailed the provisions to members. The provisions were read and discussed. It was stressed that the adoption of 501(c)(3) provisions were necessary to be granted 501 (c)(3) status. It was moved and seconded that we adopt the 501(c)(3) provisions. The vote was unanimous.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Northwest District Council. Jerry told us that the NWDC is new and improved. They now meet at the Greenwood Senior Center at 525 North 85th Street. Rob Manson will be their contact with the City and Thomas said he would also be attending. Jerry noted that it had been a traumatic process.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sidewalk on North 100th<br>

          Robin McCain talked about the grant she had obtained for sidewalks on North 100th. The sidewalks are being done section by section. Robin said she believed that the grant had been awarded because we have a design plan, and this influences us getting additional grants. Robin said that she welcomes input on the location of the section and help with the project. She said she would come next month with the plans.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">New Visitors<br>

          Our new neighborhood visitors came from Ashworth. The neighbors have gotten to know one another over the years, and do a Night Out each year. They also have a standing neighborhood Sunday breakfast. They had long talked about coming to the Community Council meetings and had finally made it!</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Land Use and Zoning<br>

          Tom Meyer reported that there was nothing of note to report, except for NSCC applying for permits to complete the second floor of the Technology Building.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">North Precinct<br>

          Ken Thompson reported that their last meeting had a presentation by the Seattle Office of Emergency Management. They want to make the public aware of what could happen when/if we experienced a large earthquake. They have preparedness classes to teach what to expect and what not to expect. It&rsquo;s important to find out what specialties people in your neighborhood possess. Who should do what. Who needs help?</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Transit Oriented Development<br>

          Tom spoke about corridors of development that are planned along lines of transit. We are in the zone (one-half mile from a hub). And with the station at the Transit Center there is discussion of a pedestrian overpass to the College, at 103rd to 105th. Capitol Hill is going through TOD planning now.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our next meeting is Wednesday, March 16, 2011. </font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The meeting adjourned at 8:35 p.m.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Respectfully submitted,<br>

          </font></p>
