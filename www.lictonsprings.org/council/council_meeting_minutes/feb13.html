are in the design phase now and outreach will be taking place later
this spring.  The next sidewalk phase will be on the north side
between Stone and Densmore, with construction in the early fourth
quarter.  Jan asked about the response of residents who have used the
area for parking.  SDOT should be ready with response to those
resisting the installation of sidewalks.  </FONT>

Mesirow asked Monty about security on the campus after the recent
assaults in the North End. Amy Lazerte said that security has been
very aware and had walked her to the bus and even driven her home

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><U>Licton
Springs P-Patch</U></FONT><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">.   Licton
Spings P-Patch Fundraising Lead, Amy LaZerte, spoke about the Spring
Fling event and other fundraising possibilities.  She thought the
suggestion of a shopping bag with the P-Patch motto was a great idea,
as was selling tilex.  Jan suggested “We dig Licton Springs
P-Patch” yard signs.  The yard signs would raise public awareness
of the P-Patch and show support for it.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Ideas
for the Spring Fling, which will take place Saturday, March 23, 2013,
are:  a groundbreaking ceremony, lively music; food; crafts for kids;
display of tool sharpening techniques.  Amy is looking into having
the goat lady and her goats for a demonstration.  She said she needs
to find out if the goats are kid-friendly.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">The
kids’ games would be old fashioned carnival type games, i.e.
tossing balls into barrels.  A game of throwing a frog beanbag at
cattails (a Licton Springs sponsored game) was suggested.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">It
was suggested that Michael Brokaw should be invited.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Another
event that Amy has thought about is “Honoring the Pear Tree.” 
This is probably an event separate from the Spring Fling event, since
it involves a funeral for the tree.  It was suggested that an artist
could paint/decorate the tree and transform it to be something that
could come back to the P-Patch.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Amy
told us that the P-Patch was remaining with the P-Patch Trust since
receiving the assurance that service will improve.  It was moved,
seconded, that LSCC will act as backup fiscal agent for the P-Patch. 
A discussion of what being a fiscal agent entails followed.  The
motion passed.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Tom
Meyer will check with “his knife guy,” who makes home calls to
sharpen knives, etc.   Having folks from Home Depot or Lowes was
discussed. Amy said that she would rather have the tool sharpener be
independent or from a small business.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Amy
passed out flyers for the P-Patch that she requested that we
distribute to our neighbors.  She also mentioned that Christian Rusby
is back in the office.</FONT></P>

 Monty informed us that the project is going forward with funding
from the State, City, and SDOT.  All experts are ready to testify. 
There are questions about safety, maintenance and who will control. 
NSCC wants to control the western node.  They need to look at land
use pressures.  There is no parking on the west side.  </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Capital
projections are right on track for a project this size.  There is a
lot coming up:  How do you deal with handicapped access; fun,
discussion, just a lot coming up.  Jan said that she would like to be
involved.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><U>North
Precinct</U></FONT><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">.  Jan asked what
was known about the transition for the North Precinct now that there
was funding for a new site.  She wondered whether NSCC could find a
use for the building.  The timeline for the new location of the North
Precinct is on a “fast train” with the goal to be in the new
facility in 2014.</FONT></P>
