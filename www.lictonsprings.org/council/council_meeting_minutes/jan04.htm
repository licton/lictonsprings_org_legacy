          Liz Kearns called the meeting to order at 7:00 p.m., welcoming everyone. 

          We gave introductions around the table, and then Liz pointed out that 

          there was not a quorum of directors present (because of directors being 

          out of town, being ill, or having other reasons to be excused). </font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><u>Minutes</u>: 

          </b> Without a quorum, the minutes from November 19, 2003 meeting could

          e-mailed to directors prior to the meeting and then usually approved 

          without discussion at the meeting. Copies of the draft November minutes 

          were passed around to the visitors.</font></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Treasurer 

          Debra Willendorf provided a Treasurer&#8217;s Report through December 

          15, 2003. Our bank balance is $1,423.69. We have approximately 8,800 

          prepaid copies, but the Newsletter will soon be copied so that number 

          will be going down. Debra asked directors to review the 2003 Approved 

          Budget, which was provided, to help in finalizing our 2004 Budget. Everyone 

          should keep in mind that we need to cut costs. Debra agreed to e-mail 

          the 2003 Approved Budget to directors not present with the request that 

          they review it in light of the 2004 Budget prior to February&#8217;s

        <p class=MsoNormal align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Liz

          respect to the new budget, Liz reported that she is attempting to find 

          musicians for the picnic who will not charge. Also, we will be having 

          a balloon man, not the Bubbleman for this year&#8217;s picnic.</font></p>

          Meetings: Liz announced that Darleen Flynn, our new representative on 

          the School Board, will be at our February meeting. David Della, new 

          member of the Seattle City Council, will come to our March meeting. 

          Mr. Della is the chair for Parks and Neighborhoods Committee. Bob Ferguson, 

          our new representative on the King County Council, or his assistant, 

          Sally Clark, will come to our April meeting. There is a possibility 

          that Trung Pham could come to our April meeting.<br>

          BUSINESS:</u></b></font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mineral 

          Springs Park:</strong> Edie Whitsett reported on Mineral Springs Park, 

          which is located between 105th North and Northgate Way, and is made 

          possible by Pro-Parks funding. She explained that the sculpture park 

          also has an area with a course for use by disc golfers. The Pro-Parks 

          funding paid for the services of a landscape architect, Charles Anderson, 

          to design the park and the construction of the park. Edie passed around 

          the &#8220;Mineral Springs Park Art Plan.&#8221; The park is under construction 

          now. Two tall nets are going up on 105th to keep frisbies in the park. 

          The first sculpture of raindrop stones (a collection of 13 carved stones) 

          is by artist Stacy Levy and will be put in place in March. The plan 

          is to have both permanent and temporary art in the park. New art would 

          be put in place each year. Edie said that she would write art grants 

          for the artwork.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Liz 

          asked if Edie had approached the College. Students going to the College 

          have done various pieces of art that are displayed around the grounds. 

          Edie said she would do so.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>100th 

          Street Project:</strong> Liz said that the City has a small pot of money 

          available for alternative sidewalks. Trung Pham, Pedestrian Program 

          Engineer, Seattle Department of Transportation, came to our November 

          meeting. There is funding for one to two blocks of sidewalks on one 

          side of 100th. The City is looking at the south side of 100th Street 

          from Ashworth and east for two blocks, while the community is promoting 

          he north side from Meridian to Densmore. Mr. Pham has explained that 

          the section of 100th with drainage problems would be very expensive 

          to work on, and at this time is cost prohibitive. Seattle Utilities 

          have to be involved.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jan 

          Brucker has suggested to the Council that before any work is done on 

          north 100th, the residents have to be informed and their opinions obtained. 

          Jan volunteered to chair a community meeting called regarding north 

          100th. Shannon Snider agreed to help Liz distribute Newsletters to folks 

          along 100th.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Re-Zoning 

          Request:</strong> Cory Johnson spoke regarding property west of Aurora 

          at North 105th and Linden. She is assisting the property owner in seeking 

          a rezoning from Single Family to L2 and came to the Council since this 

          location is within the Greater Aurora-Licton Planning Area. Jon Beahm 

          and Greg Baltzell, who are both in real estate, spoke in support of 

          Ms. Johnson&#8217;s request. Questions and discussion followed. The 

          neighboring properties are either zoned L2 or are Single Family, but 

          being used as multi-family. Ms. Johnson said that she had attempted 

          to talk to the City Council and is trying to pursue a legislative rezone 

          rather than petitioning DCLU. LSCC members agreed to look at the property. 

          Liz suggested that Ms. Johnson come back to the March meeting when David 

          Della would be present. This would also allow Board members to have 

          a look at the property.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Newsletter:</strong> 

          Debra is putting together our next Newsletter. She said that there will 

          be articles on Mineral Springs Park, Licton Springs Park, Pilling&#8217;s 

          Pond, 100th, and a bus stop article. There also will be membership information, 

          pictures, and thank yous to people who have recently given donations.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shannon 

          asked about the list serve that was discussed at previous meetings. 

          Bert Bradley is heading this up and Shannon was told that Bert would 

          have information at a future meeting. Discussion followed on e-mailing 

          the Newsletter and neighborhood information/news.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Department 

          of Neighborhoods 2004 Priorities:</strong> Liz reported that the four 

          items that were previously discussed were submitted to the City of Seattle 

          as our 2004 priorities. Liz acknowledged the hard work of Debra in assisting 

          Liz with all the cross-referencing required in the submission to the 

          City. The priorities are:</font></p>

          <div align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pilling&#8217;s 

            Pond. Yvonne Zoretic reported on the current status of Pilling&#8217;s 

            Pond. She said that there would be a January 30th meeting with Bob 

            Ferguson to hopefully get his support for the project. It was a great 

            help to us to have the previous support of Cynthia Sullivan. It was 

            not known at this time whether Bob Ferguson would follow through with 

            the $20,000.00 funding promised by Cynthia Sullivan. The committee 

            is hoping to receive the funding and be able to finalize the conservation 

            easement as a first step. They also would like to purchase a new fence 

            that is viewer friendly from the street (as at the Zoo) and that also 

            provides security, animal control, and environmental control. Yvonne 

            said that her younger sister, Melanie, and Melanie&#8217;s husband 

            moved into her grandfather&#8217;s home in June of last year. Yvonne 

            said that Melanie was familiar with taking care of the property and 

            had experience from helping their grandfather when she was younger.<br>

            $100,000.00 in Pro Parks funding this year and will get the northernmost 

            bridge replaced. The middle bridge is being worked on now. Also, Earth 

            Corp will be paid through Pro Parks for one year&#8217;s work to the 

            Park. Mineral Springs Park, discussed above, will receive $700,000.00 

            in Pro Parks funding. Liz explained that we were the only north end 

            community to qualify for capital improvement funds because of our 

            diversity. These funds paid for the replacement of the middle bridge.</font></div>

          Seattle Community College: </strong>Wally Fosmore reported that LSCC 

          serves as the standing committee for NSCC. He therefore keeps the Council 

          apprized of what is going on at NSCC. He said that the Arts and Sciences 

          Building is ahead of schedule and will be completed by the end of May, 

          and occupied in September. The renovation of the Second Floor, central 

          campus, is taking place. This involves the registration area, business 

          area, and cashiers.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wally 

          noted that NSCC has not had nearly as many rentals (i.e., school auctions) 

          this year because of the renovations going on. Future projects include 

          the library building. Also, the Master Plan process will have to be 

          begun again. This was last done in August of 1995. NSCC will need a 

          representative from LSCC for this process. Every change made at the 

          college needs to fit with the college&#8217;s strategic plan.</font><br>

          teaching facility. She pointed out that there is an excellent gym, shop, 

          and cafeteria at the school. She said that the Council has inquired 

          about meeting at Wilson-Pacific, but the charge of $90.00 for two hours 

          is too expensive for the Council.</font></p>
