        Forester, made a presentation to us concerning the plans for Licton Springs 

        Park.  She gave an overview of the Park and history of the reforestation 

        program in the City of Seattle.  She told us that the Urban Forest Restoration 

        Program was established in 1994.  The goal of the program is to assess 

        citywide what exists and then identify projects for restoration.  The 

        goal is to eventually have a sustainable forest.  Ms.&nbsp;Benz talked 

        about the vegetation that exists at Licton Springs Park and answered questions.  

        She had a drawing illustrating the Park and several trees close to the 

        play area had red stars on them.  She explained that these trees had been 

        identified as hazardous and would be removed.  She stated that the budget 

        for the project, including the initial study was $70,000.00.  <b>[Note:  

        This figure corrected downward to $48,000.00 by Jenny Benz subsequent 

        to our meeting.]</b>.  Ms. Benz said that there would be opportunity for 

        the community to have input on the project.  The plan is to begin planting 

        in the spring.</font></p>

        questions.  There was some discussion about the Kelm house.  Harold Schmidt 

        said he was against selling the house and he didn’t think it had been 

        done legally.  Marianne said that the plans for the park included a proposed 

        water feature that would use the foundation from the Kelm house as a sort 

        of cistern.  It was pointed out that the purchase contract required the 

        buyer to fill in the foundation after removal of the house and the contract

Verdana'>:</span></b><span>  </span>Wally Fosmore answered questions about the 

        College.  He was given input on effects of putting the RPZ in place.  

        It was reported that parking in the neighborhood had improved and ticketing 

        is taking place.  He said that the college has sold more permits for parking 

        in their lots.  The cost of these permits is on a sliding scale, depending 

        on how many hours the student is taking, or the employee working.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Harold Schmidt 

        questioned the cell tower the College was putting it.  He objected to 

        it and thought it would cause harm to residents.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jan Brucker 

        asked Wally is there were any plans for a performing arts center.  Wally 

        said that it was not on the horizon.  He said that the Arts &amp; Sciences 

        Building remodel had been approved by the Legislature and the College 

        was waiting to see if the $5 Million capital project funding would be 

        approved in the next legislative session.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wally told 

        us that the Interim President of the College is Dr. James Ford.  Dr. Ford 

        had previously retired after being the president of Skagit Valley College.  

        Wally said that former President Noble had been reassigned and the business 

        manager had resigned after problems surfaced earlier this year.  Wally 

        explained that many items were involved in the financial problems of the 

        College, but a large part had to do with offering too many classes spanning 

        an overly broad time period.  This required longer hours by the teachers 

        and the enrollment did not increase as had been anticipated.  He said 

        part of the problem also had to do with a pay dispute with part-time teachers 

        and a retroactive pay increase given to the part-time teachers.  He said 

        that the College was now offering the same range of programs as before, 

        but fewer sessions.  He said they had had to reduce grounds crews by 60 

        percent effective July 1<sup>st</sup>.  This was a problem because the 

        areas to keep up have increased with the recent expansion.  Maintenance 

        crews have also been reduced causing a similar problem for the buildings.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An inquiry 

        was made concerning the Indian Heritage students.  Wally said that they 

        were in three classrooms and there were a total of 65 students.  He thought 

        they were doing well.  He noted that it had taken a big effort on the 

        part of teachers and volunteers to get the Indian Heritage students and 

        accompanying materials moved over to the College.</font></p>
