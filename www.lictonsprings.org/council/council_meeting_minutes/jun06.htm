              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Andrew Morrison. Liz announced that the Seattle

                School District has given Andrew Morrison permission to paint

                another panel on the east wall at Wilson-Pacific School. Andrew

                painted the Chief Seattle mural in 2002. He now plans to paint

                a panel with Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce (one of the most famous

                Indians in American history), again with the sponsorship of the

                Potlatch Fund. Liz has attempted to get Andrew to use the farthest

                north panel for the Chief Joseph mural, but is unsure whether

                Andrew will do so or not. She suggested the advantages of having

                a mural of a pioneer woman or women between the murals of the

              two Indian chiefs.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Liz

                  told a bit about Andrew&rsquo;s interesting story. He originally

                was a young tagger who eventually went to school to study art.

                (Note: His website is <a href="http://www.onestaa.com">http://www.onestaa.com</a>. You can view his

                artwork there.)</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pillings

                  Pond Preservation Society Request: Liz said that there would

                  be someone from the PPP Society at our July meeting to talk

                  about their request to use the bond donated for the Licton

                  Springs Park Playground project for Pilling&rsquo;s Pond signage.

                Discussion followed.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ellen reported that she had talked to one of her bosses (a lawyer)

                about the situation. In that discussion it was pointed out that

                it was not a straightforward situation. The gray area is created

                because the donation was originally made in support of the Licton

                Springs Park Playground project to LSCC, a public entity. PPP

                Society is a private entity, separate from LSCC. Discussion followed.

                People were not comfortable with the public entity to private

                entity giving. Also, it was felt that surely in the future, funds

                would be needed for the Park Playground. For example, we have

                been advised that we should be putting additional fibar in place.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Newsletter: We will be doing an August Newsletter to publicize

                our September to December, 2006 meetings. Liz announced that

                anyone with stories or articles should submit them.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Seattle

                  Night Out 2006: This year the Night Out is going to be Tuesday,

                  August 1, 2006. Anyone interested in hosting a Night Out function

                  should contact the Police Department. Hosting a Night Out gives

                  neighbors a chance to meet and talk. It&rsquo;s

                a great opportunity to solicit comments and concerns. Liz urged

                all Board members to host a Night Out on their street.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wilson-Pacific School: The question about the future of Wilson-Pacific

                School is back up in the air. The announced plan to move the

                Summit K-12 program into Wilson-Pacific has been dropped. This

                is disappointing for us because having a school functioning at

                the site has been a priority for Licton Springs Community Council

                for years!</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">North

                  Seattle Community College: Liz announced that the Bruce Kieser

                  had told her in an e-mail message that the College &ldquo;has

                  been asked to look at the feasibility of adding a program where

                  social services, employment security, and training programs

                  can be integrated for improved services to students where these

                  services are located at one facility.&rdquo; The College is

                  looking at modifying existing buildings, or constructing a

                  new building to create such a program. This project is in the

                  study phase and we will hear more about it as the project develops.

                Discussion followed receipt of this information.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Liz

                  noted that NSCC is active in the community. They attend all

                  of the Northgate planning meetings, and even host them at the

                  College. Liz said she hoped that a result of the Northgate

                  planning meetings could be a pedestrian overpass over the freeway

                at North 100th. This would allow instructors, staff and students

                coming to NSCC to arrive by bus (or someday light rail) at the

                Northgate Transit Center and walk over to the College. Of course,

                we could also use the overpass to walk over to Northgate or to

                the Transit Center. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be great for everyone?</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Northgate Festival: Liz announced that the second annual Northgate

                Festival will be held this year on August 12th and 13th. Having

                a booth at the Festival would cost LSCC $50.00. Discussion followed.

                We could use the history panels made for History House and also

                have disaster preparedness information available at our booth.

                Gabriel Pedersen suggested that a raffle could be held for a

                disaster preparedness kit. This is a good way to get people to

                sign up on cards, perhaps giving their e-mail addresses (this

                would allow us to add them to our Community and/or Disaster Preparedness

                List Serves).</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ellen

                  Beck volunteered to attend the Festival and report back at

                  the September meeting. Spending $50.00 for a booth is a lot

                for LSCC. It was agreed that we need to know more about attendance

                and activities at the Festival to know if LSCC having a booth

                there would be a &ldquo;good fit,&rdquo; and a good use of our

                limited funds.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">City of Seattle Charter Amendments: Liz reported having received

                from the City the full text of the Seattle Charter Amendments

                presently being considered. Anyone was welcome to borrow this

                printout, but it was too many pages, and so unfortunately had

                not been copied. Ellen volunteered to e-mail to interested parties

                a 4-page review of the Charter Amendments which she received

                at a recent Neighborhood Coalition breakfast meeting. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mineral

                  Springs Park: Edie Whitsett has indicated that Mineral Springs

                  Park is going to begin having work parties. Dates haven&rsquo;t

                been decided as yet, but the plan is have perhaps three work

                parties.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Upcoming Events on Website: Upcoming events in the community

                were discussed and it was decided that having these posted on

                the website would be great, if that was possible. Ellen agreed

                to contact Amy Markishtum and let her know the upcoming events.

                Hopefully Amy will be able to post them on our website. The events

                are: the July 15th Grand Openings of the Northgate Library and

                Community Center; the July 15th Community Picnic at the North

                Precinct; the August 1st Night Out event; the August 12th and

                13th Northgate Festival; and the August 13th Idriss Mosque Annual

                Interfaith BBQ. </font></p>

                  Neighborhood Block Watch and Disaster Preparedness Newsletters

                went out for June 2006. Ellen offered to e-mail these to anyone

                who hadn&rsquo;t received their copies by e-mail.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A

                  discussion about Block Watch followed. It is a way for neighborhoods

                to get to know who lives on their street and to be able to learn

                what is &ldquo;normal&rdquo; for the households. Being organized

                empowers neighbors to call 911 when something doesn&rsquo;t look

                normal at a neighbor&rsquo;s house.<br>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The meeting was opened to concerns of the community.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Zoning: There was a question about the current zoning in the

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Welcome Newsletter: Donna Linn suggested that it would be a

                good idea to send a welcome letter to new homeowners. Liz thought

                perhaps we could get addresses of new owners from Roger Turner.

                Donna, who is also a realtor, said this was possible.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This

                  Year&rsquo;s Fall Picnic: Liz explained that LSCC has been

                having a fall picnic for the last seven years. In the past it

                has been sponsored by Larry&rsquo;s Market. Because of the bankruptcy

                of Larry&rsquo;s, this year&rsquo;s picnic will have to be publicized

                as a &ldquo;bring your own picnic to the Park, and enjoy the

                music and Bubbleman entertainment provide by LSCC.&rdquo; People

                will have a chance to meet their neighbors and enjoy getting
