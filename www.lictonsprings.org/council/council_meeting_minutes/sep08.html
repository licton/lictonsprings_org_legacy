                  She announced the annual Halloween in the Park would take place

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>NEW BUSINESS:</b></font></p>

              <p align="left"><b>Bob Ferguson</b><br />

                Bob Ferguson, King County Councilmember, spoke

                to us and answered questions. Bob lives in Maple Leaf with his

                wife Colleen and their young twins, Jack and Kate. He is a Seattle

              native, having grown up on Queen Anne. </p>

              <p align="left">Bob explained that the

                King County Council consists of nine members and he represents

                District One (from Green Lake to Woodinville). He talked about

                the business of the Council: Metro Transit, elections, criminal

                justice, regional issues (i.e., emergency services), as well

                as representing people living in unincorporated King County.

                The King County Council has a budget of $700 million, and 70

                percent of those monies are dedicated to justice and public

                safety needs. They are presently working on the 2009 budget,

                and the projected shortfall is approximately $90 million. The

                Council has adopted public safety, health and quality of life

              for King County residents as its top priorities. </p>

              <p align="left">He talked about

                Metro and taking the bus to work each day. He said that ridership

                is up on the buses, but costs are also rising in large part due

                to the cost of fuel. Because of a significant shortfall, a fare

                increase of $.50 is being looked at. The Council will also go

                to the Legislature for other funding methods because of having

                exhausted the sales tax venue (whereby they can increase revenues

              by one tenth of one cent at a time). </p>

              <p align="left">Elections 2009 was the next

                topic discussed. Bob told us that by 2009 we could be set up

                for voting by mail exclusively. He stressed that it will be much

                better to have one system, instead of two, although he knows

                that some people (including his mother) prefer to go to their

                polling place. The plan for 2009 is to have all mail voting,

                but have regional voting centers where people can turn in their

                ballots. Because of the current financial situation, the regional

                voting centers have been scaled back to three locations. They

              would each be open for five to seven days. </p>

              <p align="left">Bob noted that King

                County has maintained the highest bond rating available for many

                years. They must balance their budget. King County is the 13th

                largest county in the country and is larger than some states!              </p>

              <p align="left">Next, the new jail question was covered. Bob said

                that there is a need for cities to have their own jails, since

                the contract with the County to house misdemeanor jail population

                in the King County Jail downtown is expiring in 2014 (extended

                from 2012). He said, however, that the County will be involved

                with the new jail for the cities. He said that discussions were

              ongoing.</p>

              <p align="left"> The Kent Regional Justice Center is a part of

                the County judicial system. It is King County&rsquo;s general

                jurisdiction trial court. If you are summoned for jury duty,

              you may be asked to serve at the Regional Justice Center. </p>

              <p align="left">Bob

                talked about the Ten Year Plan and the Committee to End Homelessness

                in King County. He told us this is an initiative very close to

                his heart and something that the County is heavily involved in.

                Over the course of a year, it is estimated that over 24,000 people

                will experience an episode of homelessness. The homeless include

                men, women and children. People are homeless for a variety of

                reasons, including mental illness and chemical dependence. Many

                of the homeless are veterans. It is important to find ways to

              help the homeless and the County is involved in this. </p>

              <p align="left">Bob answered

                many questions and urged people to contact him with their questions

                and concerns. His phone number is 206.296.1001. </p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>OLD BUSINESS:</b></font></p>

              <p align="left"><b>North Seattle Community College</b><br />

                Bruce Kieser updated us on

                what is happening at the College. He told us that the Green Belt

                Trail has 15 markers at points of interest. He urged people to

              walk the Green Belt Trail. Dogs are not allowed. </p>

              <p align="left">The College

                is doing a paving repair project in the parking lot north of

                the library building. They are also cutting out the berm and

              making the area handicap accessible. </p>

              <p align="left">They are also cleaning up

                the area by the kitchen and will be building a screen. This is

              near the polling place. </p>

              <p align="left">Bruce told us the City will be restriping

                College Way for pedestrian safety. One lane each way will be

                turned into a bike lane (and also to provide some future parking

                on the east side of the median). Taking away one lane each direction

                will reduce the lanes of traffic and thus make it safer for pedestrians

              crossing College Way.</p>

              <p align="left"> The strategy on the additional parking is that

                this will help to discourage parking in the neighborhood. However,

                they also don&rsquo;t want to attract cars so the new parking will be priced

                to be higher than on-campus parking and time limits will perhaps

                also be imposed. NSCC is under City regulations and must charge

                for parking. <br />

              </p>

              <p align="left"><b>Open Forum</b><br />

                Because of a mailing by Bob Ferguson

                announcing tonight&rsquo;s meeting, neighbors new to LSCC were

                present. A discussion followed on what the Council did in the

                neighborhood, as well as what could be done to get the word out

              about our neighborhood. </p>

              <p align="left">Discussion was also had about zoning,

              construction, and transportation. </p>

              <p align="left">Our next meeting is Wednesday,

              October 15, 2008. </p>

              <p align="left">The meeting adjourned at 8:55 p.m. </p>
