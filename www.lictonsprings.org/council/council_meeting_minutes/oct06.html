              <p align="left"><font size="2">Liz and Robin McCain have been working on a flyer to be distributed

                has sent Licton Springs two boxes of candy. Liz said she had

                quality tasted the candies and they are excellent. What a wonderful

                surprise! PCC is donating eight gallons of organic apple cider

                and the gift cards for Fred Meyer, Costco, and Safeway have been

                cashed in for Halloween candies.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Licton Springs Park Vegetation Plan History/New

                  Grant<br />

              </b> Liz gave

                a brief history of what has transpired at the Park. In 1999 the

                Seattle Parks Department did a Vegetation Management Plan. This

                Plan listed plants that could be used in the Park and created

                zones. Since the Plan was produced, three different UWREN groups

                have worked in the Park, as well as Zoo Corp., Natural Areas

                Crews, Earth Crop., and Friends of Licton Springs Park. The bulk

                of the work of all these groups has been in the north end. The

                groups have worked on clearing and planting and weeding.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">Getting rid of reed canary grass is a real problem in the Park.

                There are various points of view as to how to control it.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">SUNP, which is now named Seattle

                  Urban Nature, is a local nonprofit organization 'dedicated

                  to enriching the quality of life in Puget Sound by engaging

                  communities to improve urban forests.&quot; It was founded

                  1998 to survey and map the vegetation and wildlife habitat

                  on 8,000 acres of public land in Seattle. They are a community

                resource for urban forest restoration </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">They are now in the process of making revisions to our Vegetation

                Management Plan and will produce a Plan that gives the history

                of work in the Park since 1999 and suggestions for future projects.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">Katie Moller, of the Seattle Parks Department, said that she

                hoped they would honor the general intent of the original Plan.

                The Parks Department is anxious about the canary grass, encampment

                problems, and that changes in wood/plants would be done in a

                way not to allow camping. She said that this is a great opportunity.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">Nelson Salisbury and Ella Elman, of Seattle Urban Nature, explained

                that they are going to look at what is in the Park now and how

                it is doing. They will be updating proposed plans, clarifying

                zones, and studying the hydrology of the overflow drain. They

                said there might be ways to direct the water into channels. The

                zones would be adjusted to reflect the habitat in the Park.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">Nelson and Ella had various plans that they have done previously

                passed around so that people could look at them. They also passed

                around overviews of Licton Springs Park.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">There was a lot of question and answer among Nelson and Ella

                and Katie, and the community members present.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">Wild flowers were discussed. It was noted that there are funky

                hydraulic areas in the Park. Nelson and Ella said that they would

                experiment with seed mixes to see what would work well in the

                Pond area, wetlands, and uplands.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>People for Transit Now!</b> Toby Crittenden of People for Transit

                Now spoke to us about Proposition 2, which we will be voting

                on in the General Election next month. Toby answered questions

                and passed around flyers for everyone to have.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Northwest District Council<br />

              </b> Jerry Owens reported that each neighborhood

                within the Council prioritizes projects each year to be funded

                from a pot of money, this year $1 Million. Two of the chosen

                projects are in Licton Springs: (1) $50,000.00 for one block

                of sidewalks between College Way and Aurora, not yet having a

                sidewalk; and (2) $18,000.00 for a traffic circle either at North

                93rd or North 94th on Stone Way. </font></p>
