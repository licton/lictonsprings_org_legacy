              NSCC Green Room</font></b></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Directors

            Present:</b> Liz Kearns, Jerry Owens, Kay Mesirow, Tom

              Meyer, and Ellen Beck.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Board

            Representatives Present: </b>Ken Thompson (Liaison to North

              Precinct) and Kathleen Braden (List Serve).</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Visitors:</b> Beth Pflug (Neighborhood District Coordinator, Department

                of Neighborhoods), Bruce Kieser (Facilities and Plant Operations

                Director for North Seattle Community College), Jean Wirch, and

              Carlos Sanabria.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Discussion about the Aurora Revitalization Workshop began first

                thing. Beth Pflug offered to send Liz Kearns links to information.

                Beth said that there was lots more discussion to come on this

              topic.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Board member Liz Kearns called the meeting to order at 7:00

              p.m. and we had introductions around the table.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There was a lot of activity going on outside the door to the

                Green Room and we hesitated to close the door. In a compromise,

                it was left slightly open and happily Carlos Sanabria joined

                us. Bruce Kieser said that we could ask Jeff Caldwell to set

                up sandwich boards announcing and giving directions to our meeting.

                We can also make a sign that can be scotch-taped to the glass

              surface out front. </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Minutes: </b>The January 21, 2009 minutes were approved as presented.

              Kathleen was thanked for doing a great job!</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Treasurer&rsquo;s Report: </b>Debra Willendorf was not able to be

                with us, but had sent the Treasurer&rsquo;s Report for the period

                January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2008 to Ellen, so copies

              were made available. </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A

          discussion of the Treasurer&rsquo;s Report followed. Although

                there is some fluctuation, dues and donations have been declining

              to a low of $255.00 for dues and $160.00 for donations in 2008.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Liz explained the history of the funds in the SCCF account.

                The plan is to leave those funds in their present location until

              LSCC has 501(c)(3) status.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There was a discussion on what LSCC could use funds for. Liz

                commented that she had spoken to Ellen about this just recently.

                At the top of a proposed list would be obtaining more copies

                of our History Booklet. It would also be good to update and reprint

                the brochure we have entitled You Live Near a Wetland, Licton

              Springs.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>NEW BUSINESS:</b></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Paper

          Newsletter.</b> Liz explained the need for doing a paper Newsletter. As

          shown on the Treasurer&rsquo;s Report, LSCC has a balance

                of approximately 6500 copies at the UPS Store. We need to take

                advantage of those copies. If the ownership of that store changes,

                we run the risk of losing our copy credits. A second reason to

                put out a paper Newsletter is that LSCC receives donations and

              memberships after paper Newsletters.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Liz

          suggested that we could produce a paper Newsletter generic enough in

          content that we can do outreach with it over a six month period. There

          are areas in our neighborhood that don&rsquo;t

                get a lot of outreach and distributing a paper Newsletter would

              be an excellent form of outreach.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Liz asked Ken Thompson to write an article about the North Precinct

                Advisory Council in a general way. He could also mention when

                the North Precinct Picnic is taking place. Ken thought that the

              date had already been selected and agreed to write an article.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kathleen Braden mentioned that a census will be happening next

                year. She stressed how important it is for everyone to be counted.

              She agreed to write an article about the upcoming census.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was suggested that we could have an article about the Community

                Council and what it has done and how it would benefit a person

                to be attend our meetings. There could also be an article about

              the parks in our neighborhood.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bruce Kieser mentioned Home Waters and the ongoing study of

                the College of the natural reclaiming of an urban environment

                happening on the grounds of NSCC. He said it was a natural laboratory.

                Michael Brocaw, the Grounds Supervisor, has been interested in

                ecology and the history of the land for over 30 years. The study

                of the wetlands is being done by the Grounds personnel, the Science

              Department, and the Biology Department at NSCC. </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another

          suggestion was an article on Pilling&rsquo;s Pond. Liz

                said that she would contact Wanda Fullner and see if Wanda would

              write an article for us.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Beth Pflug said that we could get funding help from the Department

                of Neighborhoods through an Outreach Grant. She said she would

                check on possible translating assistance. Carlos said he could

              translate several languages and perhaps could find other volunteers.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>E-Newsletter. </b>It was suggested that if we had a way for people

                to pay online, we could receive membership dues and donations

                from our E-Newsletter. Online payment options, such as Pay Pal

                were discussed. Pay Pal charges two percent for funds it collects.

              It was decided that online payment options should be investigated.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Update

          on 501(c)(3). Ellen gave an update on 501(c)(3) status for LSCC. She

          began the filling out the paperwork, and when she needed some assistance,

          Jan Brucker offered to help. Jan is an attorney and has also gone through

          the process before! Unfortunately after agreeing to assist Ellen, Jan

          had an operation to remove a brain tumor. In addition, Jan had moved

          her mother to Seattle from Gig Harbor and had there were difficulties

          with her mom&rsquo;s

                health, and other things she had to attend to. Ellen had recently

                asked Jan if the paperwork for 501(c)(3) could get submitted

              this year. Jan is sure it can be done in the coming months.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Times

            We Are Living In.</b> Carlos explained how he came to our

                meeting. He said that he lived near Kathleen and had gone to

                the Night Out function several years ago. Because of that event,

                he had given his e-mail address to Kathleen and had been put

                on the List Serve. Carlos has been reading the E-Currents ever

              since and had been meaning to come to a meeting for some time.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Carlos said that we live in scary times and it is important

              to get to know your neighbors. We all agreed!</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Summer

          Potluck Picnic. </b>The Licton Springs fall picnics were discussed. We

          were fortunate for many years to have Larry&rsquo;s

                Market in our neighborhood and they provided the food, and cooked

                the food for our community picnic. We don&rsquo;t have Larry&rsquo;s

                anymore, but perhaps we could scale back our picnic and hold

                a summer potluck picnic. This would be a nice way for the neighborhood

              to come together.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Education

            Opportunity.</b> Kathleen mentioned that LSCC should be

                educating children about ecology since we have the springs, a

                pond, and peat. Discussion followed. Coming to Licton Springs

                is a magnet school trip for north end kids. Olympic View has

                done outreach at the wetlands for years. They have 5th and 6th

                graders studying ecology. Bruce added the work of Home Waters.

              He said they can be checked out on the web at <a href="http://www.HomeWaters.org">http://www.HomeWaters.org</a>. </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Grants

          Available.</b> Beth reminded us and provided handouts on grants available.

          She said there are four opportunities each year. There are Neighborhood

          Matching Funds, Small and Simple Project Funds, Outreach Grants and

          Small Sparks. Small Sparks are grants of $250.00 and you don&rsquo;t

          have to match, just have a project. There is also the Neighborhood

          Street Fund.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Liz said that the Street Fund is where funds were obtained to

                do the sidewalks that have been done on North 100th. The design

                and plan have already been done and to get additional sidewalks

                on North 100th, someone needs to step up and head the project.

                Liz said that Shawna Walgren is a great help when a project is

              initiated.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>OLD BUSINESS:</b></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Website. </b>Liz explained the history of the LSCC website, which

                the College hosts. She said we were lucky that Amy Markishtum

              volunteers her time to assist us.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Update

            on North Seattle Community College.</b> Bruce had great,

                great news: The College obtained their enrollment goal, and stopped

                the slide. This shows that they are still viable! Shoreline Community

              College and others are struggling.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On

          top of the cuts already made at NSCC, the College will have to make

          6 &frac12; percent cuts in 2010. He said that they would

                need to cut custodial care, unfortunately, and planned to look

                at individual programs &ldquo;surgically&rdquo; in order to reach

              the necessary goal.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bruce reported the Work Source Program was doing well. He said

              the signage was understated on purpose.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

          new building won&rsquo;t go out to bid until they receive

                additional needed funding. He said the program was a new concept

                for job seekers involving orientation, retraining and personal

                growth. DSHS would participate in the program. The program would

              report directly to the Legislature!</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bruce

          mentioned that NSCC has an excellent Health Science Nursing Program,

          where the students&rsquo; training includes working

              at Northwest Hospital.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bruce

          also reminded us that in 2018-19 transit and light rail will both be

          in place at the Northgate Transit Center. The light rail station will

          be elevated. It is crucial for pedestrians to have access to the west

          side of I-5 and for the College and community to have pedestrian access

          to the Transit Center. He said LSCC needs to be involved in promoting

          this. The College will play a part, but they can&rsquo;t head this

          since they are a government entity. The overpass would accommodate

          bicyclists.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shredding Project. Beth said she would investigate what other

                organizations have done in order to afford neighborhood shredding

              events.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our next meeting is Wednesday, March 18, 2009.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The meeting adjourned at 8:50 p.m.</font></p>
