              Springs Park.</strong> Liz said that the King County grant project 

              at Licton Springs Park has been completed and the final report made. 

              She said last Thursday she had been to a Cap Stone presentation 

              at the University of Washington. There she heard reports of what 

              the groups had done at their sites (Licton Springs Park, Woodinville, 

              Vashon Island &#8211; The Sanctuary, the Duwamish, and the Center 

              for Urban Horticulture).</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 

              team of students who worked at the Park is from the University of 

              Washington and the students are with the UW Restoration Ecology 

              Network. In the fall, we will have another group, possibly two groups, 

              of students who will begin another project at the Park. The students 

              choose the part of the park that they will work in and devise a 

              plan of what to do to restore the site. They then execute their 

              plan and we are the beneficiaries. The park is improved and invasive 

              plants are suppressed. Liz is the coordinator for the students who 

              work on these projects.</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Liz 

              noted that with five to ten students working in the Park this fall, 

              it will be a good time for us to seek another grant.</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 

              Parks Department has privately acknowledged that the southern pond 

              is contaminated, so no one is supposed to touch the pond water. 

              Parks does not want it to be tested because then steps will have 

              to be taken to restore the pond, and there is no funding for that 

              at this time. Former Licton Springs Community Council president, 

              Cat Newsheller, used to dredge the pond once a year, but now that 

              has not been done for perhaps 20 years. The pond is disappearing 

              because of all the runoff and contaminates that are flowing into 

              it, and the invasive plants and other plants that are taking over 

              areas that used to be under water.</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On 

              a happy note, we are introducing chorus frog sacks at the north 

              end. Since chorus frogs are indicator species, when the pond became 

              contaminated, the chorus frogs died/left. Some people living close 

              to the pond used to complain about the noise of the frogs! Now we 

              are slowly attempting to reintroduce chorus frogs.</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 

              comfort station will open this month. The last bridge needing replacement 

              will be replaced this year.</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Picnic.</strong> 

              The Licton Springs Picnic is the second Saturday in September. Liz 

              said she is still working on the entertainment. Liz has spoken with 

              Robin McCain.</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>North 

              100th Street.</strong> There has been some feedback that parking 

              should be allowed on 100th. Also, after a woman timed cars on 100th, 

              there are now two signs on 100th, one at Densmore and one at Stone. 

              These signs say either 25 miles per hour or &#8220;Residential Zone&#8221; 

              - no one knew for sure which. Debra said she felt we should pursue 

              restricting parking. Perhaps an RPZ could be pursued. An RPZ would 

              have to be contiguous with the existing zone. Debra will investigate. 

              Discussion followed.</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ken 

              Thompson reported from the budgetary town meeting. He said that 

              Councilmember Richard Conlin had said money was available from SPU, 

              if the sidewalk in question had drainage issues. This is a way to 

              supplement monies for sidewalks.</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Liz 

              said she would follow up with Trung Pham regarding whether the 100th 

              sidewalk project had been approved. She will e-mail his response 

              to the rest of the Board.</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Pilling&#8217;s 

              Pond. </strong>Wanda Fullner reported on the first event of the 

              committee, thanking PCC for providing greens for the ducks. This 

              event was organized by Mike Bond, who is head of the committee. 

              Yvonne&#8217;s sister, Melanie, who is living in the Pilling&#8217;s 

              house, has had groups of grade school kids visiting the pond. A 

              volunteer from the University of Washington, Department of Forestry, 

              has provided some help. The committee has been working on necessary 

              paperwork and has given the paperwork to Faith Roland. They are 

              going to try for a full or a view easement. The appraisal will take 

              place in August. Bob Ferguson will provide funding for the appraisal. 

              Wanda noted that if the Pilling&#8217;s home is appraised for under 

              $300,000.00, then there is a possibility that Melanie and her husband 

              could purchase the home. If this were possible, it would be good 

              for the community.</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Advertising.</strong> 

              We continued our discussion of advertising which we had begun during 

              our May meeting. Both Ted Pickett and Staci Baldwin had approached 

              business about advertising. Ted had talked to John Appel at the 

              UPS Store. Mr. Appel had suggested interspersing advertising within 

              the newsletter. Discussion followed. It was agreed that a business 

              card sized ad would be $20.00; a quarter page ad would be $50.00. 

              Wanda said she would call Roger Turner and find out how many flyers 

              he has delivered. Ted said he could deliver 500 newsletters.</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Debra 

              said that she would not be able to keep track of the advertising. 

              Someone is needed to keep track of the advertising commitments and 

              collect the payments. She said that the businesses advertising in 

              our newsletter should also sign a minimal &#8220;contract&#8221; 

              of some kind, giving basic information and the extent of the arrangement 

              being entered into. Debra will write the &#8220;contract.&#8221;</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our 

              goal is to have four newsletters a year. We mail 425 copies each 

              time to our mailing list. Ted could distribute extra copies.</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Liz 

              said she would call Bert Bradley about our mailing list. She will 

              also ask him about the list serve project. He is apparently not 

              going to be able to proceed with it, but we need to get from him 

              what he has, if anything, for our list serve.</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Northgate 

              Stakeholders.</strong> Jerry Owens reported that the Northgate stakeholders 

              had unanimously endorsed the hybrid alternative for daylighting 

              Thornton Creek. This alternative provides the best treatment of 

              the water.</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 

              are now two subcommittees of the stakeholders&#8217; group: Planning
