              Precinct Report</strong>. Ken Thompson wondered if anyone read his 

              reports from the meetings at the North Precinct. We all assured 

              Ken that we did. Ellen reminded Ken that she turns his e-mail reports 

              into Word documents that are placed in the Licton Springs Community 

              Council Minute Book.</font></st1:PlaceName></st1:place></p>

            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ken 

              told us that Seattle has fewer police officers per 100,000 of population 

              than any other city our size in the country. In these rough economic 

              times, everything boils down to money and police attention goes 

              to the worst areas of need. Ken provided a copy of a letter sent 

              June 1, 2004 by the North Precinct Advisory Council to the Seattle 

              City Council in connection with Police Department budget cuts.</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Discussion

            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mineral 

              Springs Park</strong>. Liz announced that Edie Whitsett needs help 

              with watering this summer at the park. Liz explained that Mineral 

              Springs Park had received $700,000.00 of Pro Park funding that has 

              created an improved disc golf park plus a meditation/art park for 

              the community. A grand opening is tentatively planned for July 10th.</font></p>

              BUSINESS:</u></strong></p>

            <p align="left"><strong>Halloween in the Park.</strong> Liz reported 

              that she had spoken with Betsy Weill and that Betsy will head up 

              Halloween festivities in Licton Springs Park again. Betsy has requested 

              an additional cooler for the event.</p>

            <p align="left">Liz said that she would talk to JJ Avinger-Jacques 

              and find out the person JJ contacted at Costco for donations of 

              candy. Liz said she has a list of needed items to be donated or 

              purchased for the event.</p>

            <p align="left"><strong>Picnic at Licton Springs Park.</strong> Our 

              community picnic is always the second Saturday in September. This 

              means that this year the picnic will be on September 11th. Liz explained 

              to Vicki that the community was invited to the picnic, hotdogs, 

              etc. donated and cooked by Larry&#8217;s Market, and side dishes 

              brought by the community. The Community Council buys the condiments, 

              napkins, plastic knives and forks, etc.</p>

            <p align="left">Liz said she had been to Larry&#8217;s Market and 

              there is, again, a new manager there. His name is Don Oljar. Liz 

              has spoken to him. He wasn&#8217;t aware of our community picnic, 

              but Liz said she would refer him to the previous manager. She said 

              that she thought we needed 350 hotdogs.</p>

            <p align="left">John Appel at the UPS Store will print 400 orange 

              picnic flyers.</p>

            <p align="left">Liz reported on the entertainment. We will have Steve 

              Gold and Group Satsang. They sing songs that others can sing along 

              with, and stress that they are not performers. There is no charge 

              for this group, but we will give them a donation. Wanda Fullner 

              thought that she had seen this or a similar group at Bumpershoot, 

              and that it would be very good music and entertainment.</p>

            <p align="left">Secondly, we are going to have the Garfield Hi School 

              Jazz Combo. This will consist of three student musicians from Garfield 

              High School. We will make a donation to them also, with the money 

              going to the Garfield Jazz Foundation.</p>

            <p align="left">Discussion followed. Everyone agreed that the entertainment 

              sounded great. This is the first year that we will not have the 

              Bubbleman or something similar, but everyone felt we did not need 

              additional entertainment.</p>

            <p align="left"><strong>Mineral Springs Park.</strong> Liz explained 

              the history of Mineral Springs Park, which has just received $700,000.00 

              of Pro Parks levy funding, and includes a disc golf park and a meditation/art 

              park. Ellen Beck described what had happened at the grand opening, 

              which took place on August 14th. David Della, our City Council representative 

              and a member of the Parks, Recreation and Education Committees, 

              was present and spoke at the ribbon-cutting ceremony on behalf of 

              the City. Betty Jean Brooks spoke on behalf of Ken Bounds and the 

              Parks Department. Edie Whitsett, who adopted this park as her project 

              (coming out of the Aurora-Licton Planning Group meetings), spoke, 

              as well as Lowell Shields, representing the disc golfers. It was 

              a lovely day, the park looked beautiful, and everyone who came could 

              create their own art! Edie provided discs in honor of the grand 

              opening and anyone, who wanted to could create their own disc art 

              with paints Edie provided. The Parks Department provided a delicious 

              chocolate cake for the celebration, as well as bottled water and 

              packages of snacks. Ellen showed everyone the disc art she had made. 

              Wanda Fullner was also at the opening and concurred that it was 

              a very nice affair.</p>

            <p align="left"><strong>Newsletter.</strong> Debra said that she has 

              gotten the mailing list program from Bert Bradley. She said that 

              she had been able to edit the list, but has not printed or attempted 

              to print from it as yet.</p>

            <p align="left">The next issue of Currents will be coming out in September. 

              Debra said she had articles on Pilling&#8217;s Pond, Northgate, 

              Licton Springs Park, and would include the LSCC 2002 financial statement. 

              The picnic flyer will be an insert in the newsletter.</p>

            <p align="left"><strong><u>NEW BUSINESS:</u></strong></p>

            <p align="left"><strong>List Serve.</strong> Shannon Snider reported 

              that he had researched our website and, because it was created by 

              students at North Seattle Community College, he contacted the college 

              about setting up a list serve for the Community Council, and THIS 

              HAS BEEN DONE!! A round of applause for Shannon! Discussion followed. 

              Using the list serve can save the Council money by using it to send 

              out newsletters, picnic reminders, Halloween reminders, meeting 

              agendas, etc.</p>

            <p align="left">It was decided that we could create our list serve 

              from the e-mail addresses that have been given to us. Then we could 

              send out an initial e-mail announcing the list serve and giving 

              them the opportunity to opt out if they didn&#8217;t want to be 

              on it. Shannon said he would send the Board an e-mail link to allow 

              us to join the list serve and set our own passwords. Good work, 

              Shannon!</p>

            <p align="left"><strong>Upcoming Meetings.</strong> Guests for upcoming 

              meetings were discussed. Liz said she invite Trung Pham of SDOT 

              to report to us in September about the status of the 100th sidewalk 

              project. She said she would also contact Rick Barrett of the Haller 

              Lake Community and invite him to share with us what happened at 

              Nellie Goodhue School. It was also suggested that grant options 

              for 2005 would be a good topic.</p>

            <p align="left">The meeting was adjourned at 8:28 p.m.</p>
