      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President 

        Liz Kearns called the meeting to order at 7:12 p.m., welcoming everyone.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>NEW 

        BUSINESS:</u></b></font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ammon McWashington 

        introduced himself.  He said that the 1998 levy passed by voters allowed 

        athletic fields at five sites to be rebuilt/renovated, that is, fields 

        at Garfield, Franklin, Nathan Hale, Ingraham, and Wilson.  Presently, 

        the proposal is for Wilson to have a 90-foot baseball field, a fast-pitch 

        softball field, and overlay possibilities for a soccer field or lacrosse 

        field or football field.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. McWashington 

        next introduced Dave Anderson, engineer on the athletic field design team.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Before Dave 

        Anderson began his presentation, we continued around the room with introductions.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dave Anderson 

        then began his presentation, including overhead projections.  He said 

        that there is no real drainage system presently at the Wilson site.  The 

        asphalt surfaces to the west of the athletic fields are in poor condition.  

        He said that the present thought was that the playing fields would be 

        used for middle school or high school practices.  Mr.&nbsp;Anderson said 

        that the primary goal was to have safe athletic fields.  He said that 

        their planning area went west beyond the present fields, but stopped just 

        east of the main drainage line running north/south across the Wilson property.  

        He said that natural turf fields would be installed after a sand base 

        with under drainage system was in place.  Also, use of the fields will 

        take into account the need to rotate wear around.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. Anderson 

        outlined several options that are also going to be priced out to see if 

        it is possible to include them:  restroom, landscaping, jogging trail 

        around the perimeter, and replacing the existing perimeter fencing.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He also said 

        that the goal in developing the playing fields is to maintain maximum 

        flexibility.  On the baseball diamond they plan to have a portable pitching 

        mound to allow different levels of players to use the baseball field.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He said that 

        the fields would be used mostly for practices, not games.  Also, the fields 

        would not be in use during the winter since the grass needs time to recover 

        from the use.  Lights are not an option because lights would extend the 

        use of the fields and this would be too hard on the surface.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. Anderson 

        said that they had a budget of $700,000.00 for the construction.  He told 

        us that there would be one foot or more of sand or other combination of 

        permeable materials in preparing the fields for the new grass.  This will 

        greatly reduce the runoff that takes place.  He said that a geotechnical 

        investigation will be done on the site.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Dave Barber</u> 

        next spoke about alternatives to be taken into consideration, such as 

        daylighting of Licton Springs Creek, and taking on the site as a Grey 

        to Green project.  He also handed out a memorandum to the Licton Springs 

        Community Council regarding his suggestions in connection with the Wilson-Pacific 

        School.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Lucy 

        Morello</u> asked that we prioritize our wish list for options at the 

        site.  For example, if we want landscaping, where do we want it?</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Margaret 

        Anthony</u> said that a Grey to Green was possible for the Wilson site.  

        She said the surface for the playing fields would be grass and there would 

        be no lights.  There will be times when the fields will be available for 

        community use.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ms. 

        Anthony also mentioned that the Parks Department now has a comfort station 

        that can be built for from $30,000.00 to $40,000.00.  She said that this 

        is a bare bones structure, but it functions well.  There is no luxury 

        to it and it is open so that your feet are visible.  Theres no incentive 

        to tarry in it.  She said that we could take a look at this type of comfort 

        station by driving to 32<sup>nd</sup> Avenue Northeast, just north of 

        145<sup>th</sup> and one block west of Lake City Way.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ms. 

        Anthony told us that Kate Kaehny has been assigned to the Wilson site 

        and that she can assist us with water feature options and the Grey to 

        Green, a comfort station, and the other options.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Bert 

        Bradley</u> volunteered to contact Kate Kaehny regarding the Grey to Green 

        Project.  Ms. Anthony told us that Kates phone number is 684-7165 and 

        her e&#8209;mail address is <a

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Liz 

        Kearns announced that Carol Eychaner had been hired as a consultant for 

        the Pillings Pond project. </font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Wilson 

        Long Range Plan Committee</u>:  Jan Brucker announced a meeting regarding 

        the long-range plans for the Wilson Site for Thursday, May 17, 2001, at 

        4:30 p.m.  This will be a one and one-half hour meeting with Tom Byers, 

        Deputy Major, and others.  Anyone able to attend was urged to do so.  

        Amy Glenn is now in charge of the Wilson Project for the Department of 

        Neighborhoods.  (Elizabeth Butler had that position formerly.)  The meeting 

        is to help understand the integration of efforts at the Wilson Site.  

        We want to ensure continuing cooperation.</font></p>
