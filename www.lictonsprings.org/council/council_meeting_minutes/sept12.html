  There was discussion about the LSCC website, which sorely needs
updating.   We need someone willing to post our notices, minutes,
etc., or set up the website so that we can update it.  Students at
NSCC originally designed our web page.  We could go back to the
College and see if there are any students interested in working on
our website (for a class?).  It was also noted that Eric Johnston
volunteered to maintain our website, but he has not returned to any
meetings since making that offer.  Kay Mesirow has placed a notice in
the Currents E-Newsletter asking for Web Master volunteers, but so
far there have been no volunteers.</FONT></P>
