            <p align="left"><strong>North 100th Street. </strong>Trung Pham will 

              be at our October meeting. Liz reported that the Northwest District 

              Council has voted to have sidewalks on North 100th as their Number 

              One priority in both 2003 and 2004. That says a lot! </p>

            <p align="left">Liz urged us to contact Trung Pham with our concerns 

              about 100th. His e-mail address is <a href="mailto:Trung.Pham@seattle.gov">Trung.Pham@seattle.gov</a>. 

              His phone number is 206-684-5377.</p>

            <p align="left">Discussion followed.</p>

            <p align="left"><strong>Rick Barrett &#8211; Haller Lake. </strong>Unfortunately, 

              Rick Barrett of Haller Lake was not able to attend our meeting. 

              We were hoping to hear from Rick about what happened at Nellie Goodhue 

              School.</p>

            <p align="left"><strong>Picnic at Licton Springs Park. </strong>This 

              year&#8217;s picnic was discussed. The weather cooperated and it 

              was sunny, but also windy. We had a lighter turnout than in the 

              past, which allowed the organizers to actually relax and enjoy the 

              picnic! The Group Satsang was enjoyed by everyone. Making a $50.00 

              donation to them was discussed and agreed upon.</p>

            <p align="left">The Garfield High School Jazz Combo, consisting of 

              three student musicians from Garfield High School, was fantastic. 

              We will make a $300.00 donation to them, with the money going to 

              the Garfield Jazz Foundation.</p>

            <p align="left">Getting a higher turnout for the picnic was discussed. 

              It was agreed that better publicity was needed for next year. Larry&#8217;s 

              Market has offered to help us advertise by having flyers available 

              at checkout stands. We can also send reminders to our List Serve 

              members, as well as blanket the neighborhood with flyers. It would 

              also help to have music early on to get folks&#8217; attention. 

              This could be accomplished with boomboxes.</p>

            <p align="left"><strong>Halloween in the Park.</strong> Liz reported 

              that Starbucks has offered to donate coffee for the Halloween event.</p>

            <p align="left">Ellen reported that she had not received any response 

              from Tom Edwards of Costco, but that JJ Avinger-Jacques&#8217; phone 

              number had been used in the letter to Costco. Ellen had spoken with 

              JJ before coming to this evening&#8217;s meeting. JJ said she had 

              not yet heard from Mr. Edwards. JJ promised to call Mr. Edwards 

              the following day and get back to Ellen with news.</p>

            <p align="left"><strong>List Serve.</strong> Shannon Snider said that 

              he would e-mail directors the introductory comments/greeting that 

              will be sent out to List Serve members initially. He said that we 

              can send out messages to List Serve members with links to Currents 

              and the meeting minutes when they are available on the website. 

              We could also send members our meeting agenda as a reminder of our 

              meetings. Shannon also suggested that we should have a notice and 

              link on the Licton Springs website to allow people to join the List 

              Serve from the website. Ellen volunteered to send Shannon Amy Markishtum&#8217;s 

              e-mail address. Amy is Liz&#8217; neighbor and is the person updates 

              our website for us.</p>

            <p align="left"><strong><u>NEW BUSINESS:</u></strong></p>

            <p align="left"><strong>Seattle Community Council Federation.</strong> 

              Liz passed out the August 28, 2004 minutes from the Seattle Community 

              Council Federation (&#8220;SCCF&#8221;). Rick Barrett (of Haller 

              Lake) is vice president of SCCF. They cover a broad scope of interests 

              and concerns at their meetings. They meet at the NOAA Building on 

              Lake Union and meetings are from 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. on the fourth 

              Thursday of the month. They always have a guest speaker. The meetings 

              end with a round robin so that each community can tell what&#8217;s 

              going on. The SCCF has 501(c) status and LSCC works through them 

              when necessary on our projects.</p>

            <p align="left"><strong>Northwest District Council.</strong> The Northwest 

              District Council will be meeting next Wednesday, at 8515 Greenwood 

              Avenue North.</p>

            <p align="left">North District Council. The North District Council 

              will be meeting Saturday, September 18, 2004, at Olympic Hills Elementary 

              (13018 &#8211; 20th Avenue Northeast) from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. 

            </p>

            <p align="left"><strong>Upcoming Items for Meetings.</strong> Costco 

              is not going forward with its store on Aurora Avenue. Their decision 

              is apparently based on opposition from the community. This is something 

              that Rick Barrett perhaps has information bout. Liz said that she 

              would call Rick and see if he can attend next month&#8217;s meeting 

              and speak with us after Trung Pham gives his presentation.</p>

            <p align="left"><strong>Wilson-Pacific. </strong>We discussed our 

              concerns about Wilson-Pacific School. Wanda Fullner questioned if 

              the Board should state that we want to see a school at Wilson-Pacific 

              without getting community input. It was the consensus that the community 

              planning group that having a school at Wilson-Pacific was a priority, 

              but Liz said that we could hold a public meeting to discuss Wilson-Pacific. 

              This could take place perhaps in March of 2005. Wanda agreed to 

              investigate the zoning at Wilson-Pacific and report back to the 

              group. </p>

            <p align="left">The meeting was adjourned at 8:35 p.m.<br>
