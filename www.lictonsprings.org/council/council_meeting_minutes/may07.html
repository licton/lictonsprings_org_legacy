                  is a candidate for the Seattle School Board. Sherry said she

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Her experience includes working with a team of

                parents, teachers and neighbors to save Daniel Bagley Elementary

                (her daughter was in school there), which was failing. It took

                five years for the team to turn things around and now there is

                a waiting list at Bagley and they have 330 students (up from

                150). She has also served as President of the Seattle Council

                PTSA, co-chaired the school levy campaign, and was a committee

                member of the Community Advisory Committee for Investing in Educational

                Excellence. She has worked 20 years as an employee and finance

                  Peat Bog Regulations</b> <br>

                Steve Moddemeyer and Brennon Staley, who

                are both with the Seattle Department of Planning and Development,

                talked to us about the new proposed peat bog regulations. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The City of Seattle began focusing on areas

                in the City containing peat bog because of what happened in the

                Greenwood neighborhood. There continued ground water pumping

                associated with construction eventually caused houses to tilt,

                street pavement to rupture, and utility pipes to break. This

              was the effect of dewatering peat deposits underlying the area.                </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Peat

                  bogs are formed over tens, hundreds, or thousands of years

                  through the process where organic material in wetland areas

                  dies and falls into the wetland, new plants grow, and the cycle

                  repeats forming peat (partly decayed, moisture-absorbing plant

                  matter). A bog is typically an area of saturated, spongy ground,

                  or a small marsh or swamp. In some areas peat bogs are below

                  ground and not apparent at the surface &ndash; like in

                the Greenwood residential area. Quite a few areas containing

                peat bogs exist in the City of Seattle, including Licton Springs! </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After having the soils of the City evaluated, the

                City now has documentation showing where peat bogs exist. They

                have created two classes of environmentally critical areas, the

                highest concern being for Greenwood (Grade 1), and all other

              areas being less serious (Grade 2).                </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

                  new regulations are designed to protect peat bogs from being

                  dewatered. Under the new regulations, anyone getting a building

                  permit for an area containing peat will be restricted in how

                  they can build on top of that area. In any designated peat

                  area, groundwater pumping or draining will be prohibited &ndash; to

                avoid dewatering the peat. In cases where the water table is

                shallow, basements may therefore not be allowed. Buildings can

                still be built, but builders will have to get permits and attention

                will be focused on the soil (depth of the peat bog beneath the

                top soil) and depth to ground water. In the Greenwood Grade 1

                area, no net gain in surfacing (asphalt, concrete, etc.) will

                be allowed in new construction or improvements in order to ensure

              the amount of percolation of rain to groundwater is not lessened.</font></p>

              <p align="left"> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Steve

                  and Brennon had aerial photos of our neighborhood, and the

                  areas containing peat bogs were highlighted. The wetlands at

                  the north end of NSCC and west to the North Precinct and also

                across I-5 to the transit station were highlighted, as was Licton

                Springs Park. They said that there was likely peat in the Pilling&rsquo;s

              Pond area, also.</font></p>

              <p align="left"> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

                  new regulations would affect approximately ten percent of the

                  City of Seattle, but are necessary to avoid situations where

                  neighbors&rsquo; houses, utilities and streets

              are adversely affected by development in peat areas. </font></p>

                Cleanup. Debra suggested that perhaps next year we could arrange

                for a dumpster to be brought into the neighborhood, and have

              a neighborhood cleanup. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Discussion followed. All were in favor

              of this idea.</font></p>

                Ellen read an e-mail

                received from Shanna Woo Ganem, who lives in the neighborhood.

                Shanna had heard there was a request for a permit on the west

                side of 95th and Aurora for a strip club, following the City&rsquo;s

                lifting of its strip-club moratorium. Discussion followed. We

                are not really equipped at this time to act quickly on something

                like this. It was determined that Shanna&rsquo;s information

                should be forwarded to the GAIN folks, since they are organized

              to respond to things happening on Aurora. </font></p>

                The community garage sale was discussed. Because

                no one had the time to head up this event, it was decided that

                it would not be held this year. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>List

                Kathleen Braden reminded everyone that she needs to receive

                new e-mail addresses for the list serve. She suggested that

                perhaps we could have information or applications at the HT

                Market.</font></p>

              <p align="left"> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Debra

                  said that we need to make full use of having a list serve.

                  She wondered if the meeting agenda couldn&rsquo;t

              be sent out by the list serve. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ellen said that LSCC definitely

                should have a presence at the Northgate Festival. This is an

                event that draws in many neighborhood people and there is entertainment

                and food, as well as booths with information about businesses

              in the community. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tom said that he believed that a domain name

                gave us one or more e-mail accounts. We could perhaps have an

                e-mail address of info@lictonsprings.org. If people visiting

                the website were directed to e-mail to that address to be added

                to the List Serve, those e-mails could be automatically forwarded
