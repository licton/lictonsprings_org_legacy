Debra Willendorf passed out Treasurer’s Report: January 1, 2012
through December 31, 2012 and January 1, 2013 through April 17, 2013.
 She noted that donations are down.  We did receive a donation from
the Pillings Pond Preservation Society of $722.46.  We spent $167.98
on Halloween, but received donations of $183.12.  We also had general
donations of $365.00 and book sale proceeds of $38.00.  Our ending
balance for 2012 was $6,352.58.  In the first three and a half months
of 2013, we received donations of $150.00 and expenditures of $275.00
to the Licton Springs P-Patch and our ending balance as of April 17,
2013 was 6,227.58.  Debra asked anyone who has expenses to turn in
should do so they can be reimbursed.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><U>Pollination
Path</U></FONT><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">.  Sabreek Woodward
and Treena Sterk presented the idea of a Pollination Path from Wilson
Pacific to/into Licton Springs Park.  This is something that can be a
project for the kids.  The Pollination Path would encourage
butterflies and bumble bees.  They would plant all native plants: 
Tiger Lily, Lupine, Penstemon, Red Columbine, Camas and Oregon Grape,
among others.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">They
wanted to get the support of the community.  They were informed that
Liz Kearns would have to give the go-ahead concerning the Park.   It
was also pointed out that the Parks Department would have to agree to
the Path, as well. </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><U>Blanchet
Stadium</U></FONT><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">.  Eric Johnston
reported that he had formed a new online called
BlanchetNeighbors.com.  They now have block captains for the
neighborhoods around the school.  They have also had a sound study,
paid for by donations.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Lee

them, including backgrounds of zoning and codes, environmental and

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">They
have been waiting a month and a half for the staff level decision of
the City.  They have argued that SEPA is required.  Blanchet, a
private school, has had six separate projects (all linked) since
2000.  They have turned two houses into offices.   Blanchet is
located in a residential community and are trying to claim precedents
that the City has given to public schools in the Seattle School
District.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Discussion
followed.  Blanchet made their application in November 2011, with the
intent to complete construction last fall.  They will probably try to
get construction finished this year.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">The
noise of the stadium exceeds 10 decibels, a doubling of perceived
noise.  This level of noise is allowed in public events, i.e.,
parades.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">The
stadium is projected to be in use five nights a week until 10:00
p.m., with varsity football games lasting until 10:30 p.m.  Two
nights a week the use would be until 6:00&nbsp;p.m.  This would be
from the fall until early spring.  It would encompass soccer games
for boys and girls, lacrosse for girls and boys, junior varsity
football and freshmen football.  There would also be football and
soccer practices on the field.</FONT></P>

reported that their recent meeting had been about 911.  What is
probably not known by most people is that a translator can be
requested in English for a caller’s native language.  Ken wondered
how we can make this feature better known.  </FONT>
