        October&nbsp;17, 2001<br>

        NSCC President's Board Room</font></b></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Directors         Present</u>: Liz Kearns, Jerry Owens, Debra Willendorf, Wanda Fullner, 
Yvonne Zoretic and Bert Bradley.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Board Representatives Present</u>:  Ken Thompson (North Precinct Representative), Pam 
Larsen (Seattle City Light Representative), and Wally Fosmore (North Seattle 
Community College Representative).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Visitors</u>:  Lucy Morello (Project Manager, Seattle School District), Kathy Johnson (Lead 
Facilities Planner, Seattle School District), Edie Whitsett (North Park Project 
Chairperson), Tom Prigmore (North Seattle Community College/Phi Theta Kappa), 
and John Mark.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Liz Kearns called the meeting to order at 7:05 p.m., welcoming everyone.  
We then went around the table and all present introduced themselves.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>Minutes</u>:</b>  The September 19, 2001 meeting minutes were approved as presented.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>Treasurer's Report</u>:</b>  Debra Willendorf submitted a written Treasurer's report showing 
LSCC having a balance of $291.93 as of October 16, 2001.  Debra expressed concern 
over the low balance.  Liz reminded everyone that our November meeting will focus 
on budget, membership, the Newsletter, mailing list, and bulk mail status.  Discussion 
ensued about funding the mailing of a membership drive/Newsletter.  Wanda 
suggested that if we could do it as part of a Pilling's Pond mailing, we may be able to 
use those funds.  One option was to do the next Newsletter/membership drive 
mailing in January.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>NEW BUSINESS</u>:</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Update on the Wilson-Pacific Site</u>.  Kathy Johnson and Lucy Morello showed us the 
final drawing for the Wilson Athletic Field Upgrade.  The drawing showed field use 
for football, soccer, baseball, and softball, plus the proposed landscape trees and their 
locations.  Ms. Morello explained that the Seattle School District is now entering the 
permit process and as long as there are no delays due to appeals, the next process, 
which is bids, will begin in January/February 2002.  Next there will be a "base bid" 
with alternates, i.e., jogging path around the perimeter of the field, landscaping, 
restroom, and new fencing (these alternates are listed in order of priority).  The 
alternates will only happen if there is money available after the field development.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Liz stated that the Licton Springs Community Council is willing to work with the 
School District to obtain grants to help fund the "alternates."  Lucy Morello directed 
the Council on how to proceed with investigating working with the School District.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wally Fosmore stated that it might be of benefit for the LSCC to get a full set of plans 
now, even if they are only 60 percent complete, so that the community has a comment 
period before the architects/engineers have completed the drawings.  Wanda Fullner 
expressed an interest in getting a set of drawings now, especially the drainage plans, 
so that the Pilling's Pond engineer can have an opportunity to review them.  Liz 
Kearns emphasized that the LSCC supports the redevelopment at the Wilson-Pacific 
site.  Lucy Morello agreed to get a full set of draft plans to the LSCC for use by the 
Council and its committees.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We discussed the Licton Springs Community Council applying for a Grey-to-Green 
Grant to help with the restroom and a small grassy area.  Neil Thibert (Seattle Public 
Utilities) has said he would be interested in partnering with LSCC on any project that 
removes "hardscape."  Ms. Morello suggested we contact Gretchen Miller with a 
project proposal as Ms. Miller handles all Grey-to-Green Grants.  We should wait until 
the bids are completed, just in case there is enough money to do most or all of the 
alternatives.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After the bidding process is completed, the contract must be approved by the Seattle 
School Board.  Then a Notice to Proceed ("NTP") is issued to the contractor and work 
begins.  The Seattle School District will handle maintenance of this field.  Questions 
about appeals should be directed to Scott Kemp of DCLU.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kathy Johnson was asked about the future use of the buildings at Wilson-Pacific 
School.  Ms. Johnson said that the School Board is holding a workshop in 
December/January to discuss school size and the outcome of that workshop will help 
decide the reuse of Wilson.  The current Seattle School District ideal middle school 
size is 600 to 800 students.  Enrollment now is 700 to 1200, so another middle school is 
needed.  When asked what we could do to have Wilson seriously considered as a 
middle school site, they suggested we write a letter to Steve Brown, our School Board 
representative, with the community's wishes clearly stated.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wally Fosmore asked what needed to happen to the buildings before a student body 
could be housed at Wilson.  Kathy Johnson said some plumbing work was needed, 
restroom renovation, and interior paint.  She also said it was very important to have 
an attractive school program that will ensure student enrollment.  Currently the 
School District offices are scheduled to move downtown in the fall of 2002.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Concern was expressed for the site being left vacant for an extended period of time.  
What should the community do?  Maintaining contact with the School Board members 
was encouraged.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>OLD BUSINESS</u>:</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Mural Small and Simple</u>.  Because J.J. was ill and unable to attend our meeting, an 
update was given by Wanda Fullner.  Wanda gave a little history on Andrew 
Morrison and why he painted the current murals.  J.J. is going to ask for Small and 
Simple monies to help paint the gym wall that faces Wallingford Avenue.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Resident, John Mark, who lives across from the current murals, stated that he believes 
people are distracted by the murals at the intersection of North 92nd and Ashworth.  
He feels it will just be a matter of time before there is an accident.  Mr. Mark said that 
he is not opposed to murals facing Wallingford because they are a greater distance 
from the street.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A suggestion was made that the Wilson magnet school program be an arts school.  It 
was suggested that a letter be sent to the School District with that suggestion.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Halloween in the Park</u>.  Halloween in the Park will be from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.  
Planning is going well and J.J. is contacting companies about donations for the event.  
Expenses should not be $125.00 (budgeted amount).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Pilling's Pond</u>.  There was a review of the Pilling's Pond objectives that were e-mailed 
to Board members.  Wanda Fullner moved and Debra Willendorf seconded 
supporting the objectives.  There was unanimous approval.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Northgate.</u>  Liz talked about the Northgate Community Center Planning Committee.  
The Parks Department has requested a representative from Licton Springs community 
serve on the committee, whose purpose is to be an advisory group for the new 
Northgate Community Center.  The group would meet once a month for a year.  Edie 
Whitsett expressed interest.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>College Way Meridian Clean-Up</u>.  Tom Prigmore, president of the North Seattle 
Community College Honor Society, announced the Society is organizing a College 
Way Meridian clean-up with the help of Sea Tran and the LSCC for November 17, 
2001, from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.  A flyer will be printed and distributed to homes 
around the college.</font></p>


<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The meeting was adjourned at 9:10 p.m.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Respectfully submitted,<br>
