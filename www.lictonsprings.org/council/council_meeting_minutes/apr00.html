        R.J. Leonard (Seattle Police Department – Parking Division), and Andrew 

        Schmid (Cynthia Sullivan’s Office).</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President 

        Liz Kearns called the meeting to order at 7:04 p.m. and those present 

        introduced themselves.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jan Brucker 

        informed those present that Greg Nichols (King County Councilman), who 

        was scheduled to speak at our meeting, had telephoned her early this morning 

        to say that he would be unable to attend because of having to attend another 

        meeting.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>Minutes</u>:  

        </b>The March 15, 2000 meeting minutes were approved as presented.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>Treasurer’s 

        Report</u></b>:  Nancy Sharp reported a balance of $1206.07 in LSCC’s 

        bank accounts.  Nancy also gave the Annual Report of Treasurer.  She felt 

        that our higher balance reflected more awareness of the Council because 

        of the neighborhood planning effort.  Many more people are paying dues.  

        Nancy said this gave us the opportunity to think about how we wanted to 

        budget our income.  The Treasurer’s Annual Report was approved and accepted.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>President’s 

        Report</u>:</b>  Liz Kearns gave Board members a written President’s Year-End 

        Report.  She also announced that the LSCC budget was on the agenda for 

        the May Board meeting.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>Sound 

        Transit/Light Rail/Northgate Station, etc.</u>:  </b>Liz next turned the 

        meeting over to Roger Iwata, who is with Sound Transit.  Mr. Iwata brought 

        us up to date on Sound Transit’s planning/activities since the November 

        1996 levy was passed by voters to improve mass transit.  He reminded us 

        that there were three parts to the transit plan:  express buses; commuter 

        rail, and electric light rail.  He invited people to visit the Sound Transit 

        website at <a href="http://www.soundtransit.org/">www.soundtransit.org</a> 

        for information.  Mr.&nbsp;Iwata said that Sound Transit was working to 

        integrate the transit systems of King, Pierce, and Snohomish Counties, 

        by routes, connections/transfers, and payments working within the different 

        county systems.  Commuter rail would begin in the fall and trains would 

        run between Tacoma and the King Street Station on the existing commercial 

        tracks.  It is estimated that the trip will take 55 minutes.  It is estimated 

        that by 2002 commuter rail would be going from King Street Station north 

        to Everett; and also further south (of Tacoma) in Pierce County.  Mr.&nbsp;Iwata 

        explained that the light rail component actually involved two systems.  

        The first system would be from the Tacoma Dome to the central business 

        district.  There will be very frequent trains for 20 hours a day.  The 

        second system would run from SeaTac and north to Northgate.  Mr.&nbsp;Iwata 

        said that many meetings and public forums have been held and will continue 

        to be held to get public input on the route, method of travel (underground, 

        elevated), and location of stations.  Mr.&nbsp;Iwata answered questions 

        from those present during his presentation and after he had completed 

        his comments.  He noted that the budget has set asides for impacts created 

        by the light rail system when noise concerns were expressed.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Liz Kearns 

        and Jan Brucker both mentioned that Licton Springs believes that a tunnel 

        from the west side to the east side of I-5 is crucial for this community.  

        The tunnel envisioned would be spacious (as wide a space as the area under 

        I-5 at Northgate Way), but the pathway would have the same dimensions 

        as the Burke-Gilman Trail.  The remaining area would be taken up by a 

        daylighted Thornton Creek.  The pathway would be for pedestrians and bicycle 

        riders, but could be used by emergency vehicles if necessary.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dave Barber 

        noted that in meetings in connection with the North Seattle Community 

        College Master Plan, the College had received a commitment from Sound 

        Transit for a tunnel/underpass.  Dave noted that there are 7,000 households 

        in this community and that 8,300 students attend NSCC.  There needs to 

        be a tunnel to facilitate everyone from the west side of I-5 getting easily 

        to the Transit Center.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Andrew Schmid 

        recommended that the Council contact representatives at the State level, 

        the Department of Engineers, and also go back to the College on the tunnel 

        issue.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>Parking, 

        RPZ, Enforcement</u>:</b>  Officer R.J. Leonard, who is with the Seattle 

        Police Department, Parking Enforcement, told us that because of how our 

        RPZ was going to be set up it would be difficult for the SPD to enforce.  

        No parking except by permit was the easiest type of RPZ to enforce.  Debra 

        Willendorf explained that SeaTran would allow our RPZ to be moved up to 

        an only by permit RPZ, but we had to begin with an RPZ that set hours 

        for restricted parking.  Officer Leonard told us that if we had illegal 

        parked cars to report, it was best to call the non-emergency 911 number, 

        because the officers give preference to radio calls.  Officer Leonard 

        also told us that he had very few officers to cover a very large area, 

        and that annual requests for more parking enforcement officers did not 

        meet with success.  Also, recommendations from Parking Enforcement to 

        SeaTran regarding RPZ’s were not accepted by SeaTran.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Andrew Schmid 

        advised us to put pressure on the City to get more officers.  The budget 

        planning process was going on right now, so this would be a good time 

        to give our comments and requests to the City Council.  He also said that 

        the Council needs to hear about the problems between SeaTran and SPD.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A discussion 

        of parking problems followed.  It was noted that because there were no 

        residences in the area where the North Precinct officers park their cars, 

        it was impossible to establish an RPZ in that area.  Randy Elder was asked 

        to bring the topic of parking problems to the next North Precinct meeting 

        he attends.  Other locations for officers to park their cars were discussed.  

        It was noted that the officers do not want to park en masse very far away 

        from the Precinct because they fear vandalism to their personal vehicles.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wanda Fullner 

        suggested we find out if citizens can place notices on illegally parked 

        cars as a way to assist RPZ enforcement.  Randy said that he would find 

        out.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>Community 

        Plan Implementation</u>: </b> David Hemmelgarn (684-0701), who is with 

        the City of Seattle Executive Department, Real Estate Services, reported 

        to us on the City Light substation.  He again provided us with maps showing 

        the area around the substation.  He said that the substation lot is being 

        cleaned up.  It was unclear if this was the work of City Light or a tenant.  

        David reported that the substation property had moved up to No. 1 on the 

        list of properties to receive environmental assessments.  This was a good 

        sign.  He said that <u>when</u> City Light officially declares the substation 

        to be surplus, other City departments are informed and have the opportunity 

        to claim the property.  It normally takes 30 days for the notice process 

        to be completed.  He acknowledged the meeting of neighbors in the vicinity 

        of the substation and their preference for affordable housing in that 

        location.  Discussion followed.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">David reported 

        that LSCC should write a letter (by July) to the City of Seattle Executive 

        Department, Real Estate Services, expressing the preferences of LSCC for 

        the substation property.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>New 

        Business – Director Elections</u>:</b>  Dave Barber presented the following 

        motion for consideration; it was seconded by Randy Elder:</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>That 

        the Bylaws of the Licton Springs Community be amended by insertion of 

        the following paragraph in the section concerning election of officers:</span></font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“The president 

        of the Board of Directors shall be limited to two successive terms in 

        office, but may serve as president again after another person has held 

        that office.  All former presidents of the Community Council shall be 

        additional, <i>Ex Officio</i> members of the Board of Directors, as long 

        as they are residents in the community, or unless they resign from such 

        office.  All <i>Ex Officio</i> members of the Board of Directors shall 

        have full voting rights on any matters to be decided by the Board, but 

        their presence shall not be required to attain a quorum for action by 

        the Board.”</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Discussion 

        followed.  Board members suggested more time for consideration would be 

        helpful.  The secretary volunteered to e-mail the motion to Board members 

        the following day for their further consideration.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Liz Kearns 

        next asked the secretary to poll all members with terms expiring as to 

        their willingness to continue:</font></p>

        Ellen Beck                - Willing to continue.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Randy moved 

        and Nancy seconded that the above members be elected by acclamation.  

        This motion passed unanimously.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Next Nancy 

        Sharp confirmed that she was resigning.  Appreciation for all the hard 

        work done by our Treasurer was expressed.  We’ll miss you, Nancy!</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Debra Willendorf 

        was nominated to complete Nancy’s term (till 2001).  Randy moved and John 

        Meerscheidt seconded the nomination.  Debra was unanimously elected.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>Committee 

        Reports</u>:</b></font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Licton 

        Springs Park.  </b>Wanda Fullner gave a report on the bathroom door at 

        Licton Springs Park.  She said that she and Liz had met with Chris Williams, 

        Rick Nichi, and Patrick Miriam (crew chief).  Wanda and Liz stressed to 

        the gentlemen that it was very important to LSCC that the men’s door remained 

        locked until the bathroom is safe.  The Parks Department proposed that 

        the bathroom be torn down in 2001 and that a new comfort station be built.  

        They said there was funding for this.  In the meanwhile, a Honey Bucket 

        would be installed for use in place of the men’s bathroom.  Liz and Wanda 

        proposed to Parks that LSCC could pay the rental fee for the Honey Bucket 

        through year 2000.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Questions 

        and discussion followed from those present.  Jan Brucker stated that she 

        would prefer that we use our funding to move the men’s bathroom door.  

        She said that we had to be sure we had a firm commitment from Parks and 

        that the funding would still be available when the time came to replace 

        Licton Springs Park’s comfort station in 2001 as Parks was proposing.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wanda said 

        that she would get confirmation from the Parks Department regarding timing, 

        funding, etc. for the new Licton Springs Park comfort station.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">John Meerscheidt 

        reported that there could be a proposal to take the east side of Licton 

        Springs Park for increased water retention after the drainage basin study.  

        Discussion followed.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dave Barber 

        urged the Board to inform David Hemmelgarn of our concerns in writing.  

        We should also communicate with the Mayor and City Council.  We need to 

        make our voices heard.  He said that compared with other communities, 

        we do not have much political clout.</font></p>
