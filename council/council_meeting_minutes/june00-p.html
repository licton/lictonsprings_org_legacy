  SPRINGS COMMUNITY COUNCIL</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Minutes of Board Meeting:  

  June&nbsp;21, 2000, NSCC North Star Dining Room</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><u>Present</u>:  Liz Kearns, 

  Jerry Owens, Randy Elder, Bob Messina, Wanda Fullner, Bethany Ryals, Edie Whitsett, 

  Wally Fosmore, Pam Larsen, and Ellen Beck.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><u>Absent</u>:  Jan Brucker, 

  John Meerscheidt, Debra Willendorf, and Sheryl Stich.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><u>Visitors</u>:  Nancy 

  Sharp, Ken Thompson, Ann Patterson, Jean Wirch, Harold Schmidt, Lindsey Packwood, 

  Guillemette Regan, Gil Schieber, Elizabeth Nucci, David Hemmelgarn (Seattle 

  Executive Services Department, Real Estate Services, Strategic Planner), Jan 

  Avinger-Jacques, Evelyn Lemon, Jana Christensen, John Laboritz, and Jodell Gillig.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">President Liz Kearns called 

  the meeting to order at 7:09 p.m., and those present introduced themselves.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b><u>Minutes</u>:  </b>The 

  May 17, 2000 meeting minutes were amended to correct the spelling of Brewster 

  Denny’s name, and then approved as corrected.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b><u>Treasurer’s Report</u></b>:  

  Randy Elder stated that because the change-over had not been completed as yet, 

  there would be no Treasurer’s Report.  Wanda Fullner did provide copies of the 

  2000/2001 Budget approved at last month’s meeting.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b><u>Densmore Drainage 

  Study.</u>:  </b>Liz next turned the meeting over to Pam Miller, who is a Senior 

  Project Manager, Project Management, Seattle Public Utilities, and is in charge 

  of the Densmore Drainage Study.  Pam told us that R.W. Beck had been hired by 

  SPU to perform the study, which is currently being done.  She said that R.W. 

  Beck would come up with a set of recommendations and that presentations would 

  be made to the community and community input would be considered.  The final 

  recommenda­tions will then be developed into a plan that will be presented to 

  the City Council.  The timing is (i) for the presentations to the community 

  to happen in September, 2000, and (ii) for the full recommendation to be completed 

  in November, 2000.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Pam Miller had various 

  maps and charts and described for the meeting attendees the job of Seattle Public 

  Utilities.  She said that drainage studies were being done in order to develop 

  solutions for the City as a whole.  The studies take time because of the monitoring 

  that is necessary.  She said that the goal was for the City to be able to experience 

  a 25-year storm without damage.  The City can also experience 100-year storms, 

  but the goal is not to gauge preparedness on such storms, but rather what is 

  categorized as a 25-year storm.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Pam Miller was asked about 

  when work could be expected to take place in Licton Springs Park.  She said 

  that her best guess was that that work was four to five years down the line.  

  She said that people could call her with questions (684-5179) or could e&#8209;mail 

  her at <a

href="mailto:pamela.miller@ci.seattle.wa.us">pamela.miller@ci.seattle.wa.us</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Based on Ms. Miller’s estimated 

  timing for Licton Springs Park, Wanda Fullner made a motion that the Licton 

  Springs Community Council lobby the Parks Department to immediately go forward 

  with reconstruction of the bridges in Licton Springs Park.  This motion was 

  seconded and unanimously passed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b><u>Community Plan Implementation</u>: 

  </b> David Hemmelgarn (684-0701), who is with the City of Seattle Executive 

  Department, Real Estate Services, reported to us that his department was surveying 

  properties owned by the City and not currently in use and would be reporting 

  back to the City in the near future.  He said that the recommenda­tions would 

  be made in July.  He said he could inform us that the Kelm House had been sold 

  at auction by Murphy’s.  Harold Schmidt confirmed that it had been sold for 

  $8,250.00 and he also questioned if proper notice had been given for the auction.  

  Harold said that it had not been very well publicized.  Edie Whitsett said that 

  removal of the Kelm House could take up to eight months because of required 

  permits, etc. needing to be first obtained by the buyer.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">David told us about City 

  Light’s plans to expand employee parking spaces.  He said that City Light has 

  approximately 385 employees and currently 192 parking spaces in Areas A, B, 

  and D, plus some senior management parking spaces not in the designated areas.  

  He said that in 2002, 90 additional parking spaces will be added in Area C, 

  presently a storage yard.  He passed out copies of City Light’s site plan showing 

  these areas.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">David passed out copies 

  of a photo showing property ownership in the proposed redevelopment area (Aurora 

  Avenue Neighborhood Commercial District – area between Aurora and Stone Avenue 

  and North 100<sup>th</sup> and North 97<sup>th</sup> Streets).  He mentioned 

  that our Plan discussed development of mixed use in the area shown.  He stressed 

  that the “committee” should give the City good advance notice of requested zoning 

  changes and/or other changes for this area, and he said that he can be of assistance 

  to us in this regard.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">David said that the City 

  Light substation was going to be surplused and sold.  A short discussion was 

  had.  He mentioned that neighbors on the street had been in favor of selling 

  the lot to Habitat for Humanity, but that the property would be put to bid.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Randy Elder passed out 

  copies of <i>Licton Springs Magazine</i>.  He suggested that perhaps we could 

  sell these magazines to raise money for the Council.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b><u>EIF</u>:  </b>Liz 

  next gave a summary of Licton Springs EIF proposals and the areas in which early 

  implementation funds had already been expended:  (1) outreach (producing the 

  community’s newsletter for one year, updating our mailing list); (2) kiosks 

  (one has been ordered for Licton Springs Park); (3) historical project; and 

  (4) North Park.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Liz spoke about the historical 

  project component.  Our neighborhood has a rich history going back to Native 

  American times and the early history of Seattle.  She announced that the Historical 

  Committee will be meeting Monday, June&nbsp;26, 2000, at 7:00 p.m. in the President’s 

  Board Room at NSCC.  Everyone was welcome to participate.  Liz noted that a 

  consultant would be hired to assist in the creation of a pamphlet or small book.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Edie Whitsett next spoke 

  about the North Park Project.  She described the “park” between 105<sup>th</sup> 

  and 107<sup>th</sup> with Northgate Way bordering on the north, and the property 

  line with the Park Meridian Condominiums on the south.  She said the park had 

  been used by Disc Golf players for ten years and that members who played there 

  had done the bulk of the maintenance work.  Edie said that a Park Committee 

  had been formed and the landscape architectural firm of Anderson &amp; Ray had 

  been chosen to assist the Committee in planning for the improvements for North 

  Park.  She said that one Park workshop had already been held on Saturday, June&nbsp;3<sup>rd</sup>.  

  She urged anyone interested to come to the next workshop, Wednesday, June 28, 

  2000, 7:00&nbsp;p.m. in the NSCC Rose Room.  She said that the architects would 

  have three concept plans for the group to consider and offer suggestions and 

  responses.  Edie had one of the preliminary concept plans to illustrate what 

  could be expected.  She also passed out North Seattle “Disc Golf” Park Surveys 

  and a flyer on Park News.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Those in attendance broke 

  into discussion groups and the meeting was adjourned at 8:46 p.m.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Respectfully submitted,</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Ellen M. Beck</font></p>
