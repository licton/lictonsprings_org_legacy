        Liz Kearns called the meeting to order at 7:04 p.m. and everyone introduced 

        themselves.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>Minutes</u>:  

        </b>The January&nbsp;17, 2001 meeting minutes were approved as presented.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>Treasurer’s 

        Report</u></b>:  Debra Willendorf submitted a written Treasurer’s report 

        reflecting LSCC’s balance being $910.31 as of February&nbsp;20, 2001.  

        Debra noted that we have billed and expect to be reimbursed soon for a 

        $204.51 EIF expenditure.  A budget will be represented at our March 2001 

        meeting.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bob Messina 

        brought up the annual Picnic and said that an early decision on details 

        should be made.  Liz Kearns and Jerry Owens are seeking another member 

        to the committee and Liz said that she would be putting a notice in the 

        next Newsletter to see if anyone new might be interested in helping on 

        this community event.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>NEW 

        BUSINESS:</u></b></font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Morgan 

        Dutton</u> from TREEmendous Seattle spoke first.  She said that TREEmendous 

        is a nonprofit organization.  Their goals is to have more trees planted 

        in the City.  They would have people at the upcoming work party at the 

        Park on February&nbsp;24<sup>th</sup>.  Morgan told everyone that TREEmendous 

        are the ones who provide trees for parking strips.  They supply the trees, 

        training and tools needed on planting day and the residents do the planting.  

        It is a goal to get block captains involved in organizing tree plantings 

        on their streets.  But before any planting City Light must be contacted 

        to get parameters allowed and the location of all City services, i.e., 

        water, electric, and gas.  Block captains would get additional “tree” 

        training.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Jenny 

        Benz</u> announced that the Licton Springs Park Plan will be available 

        in early March.  She said that besides the February 24<sup>th</sup> work 

        party at the Park, there will be additional work parties on March 31<sup>st</sup> 

        and April 21<sup>st</sup>.  She passed out information from King County 

        concerning Puget Sound Urban Resources Partnership, which supports “local 

        efforts to improve the urban natural environment by pooling available 

        resources, leveraging funding and building sustainable partnerships.”  

        She said that applications have to be submitted for this funding source 

        and she was more than willing to help us write the application.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Belinda 

        Gigliotti</u>, our new Seattle Parks Department Northwest Sector Manager, 

        spoke next.  She is just working on getting up to speed on Licton Springs 

        and wasn’t prepared to answer questions with specific answers at this 

        time.  She said that she had not as yet had her full briefing time with 

        Margaret Anthony.  Belinda was updated on Licton Springs Park by Liz and 

        others.  Jenny Benz suggested she talk to Sandy Bell and Karen Galt.  

        Belinda was asked about the comfort station.  Liz said that she was hoping 

        the comfort station would be remodeled as the current comfort stations 

        being installed by the Parks Department are constructed of concrete and 

        tin.  Belinda was told that Christopher Williams was the one to contact 

        about the comfort station, as we have been told that funding exists for 

        it.  Belinda said that she had a lot of work to do to get up to speed 

        on our projects and needs, but she would do so.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Lindsey 

        Amtmann</u>, who lives at 88<sup>th</sup> and Midvale, spoke about the 

        desire to find folks interested in developing a P-Patch in the neighborhood.  

        It was suggested that she write an article for the Newsletter and she 

        agreed to that.  Possible sites for P-Patches were mentioned.  Bob Messina 

        mentioned that there is a P-Patch Committee.  Lindsey said that she has 

        contacted that group.  Liz said that she would connect Lindsey with David 

        Hemmelgarn because he will be able to identify all the publicly owned 

        parcels in the neighborhood.  Jenny Benz also offered to obtain an ownership 

        map.  Lindsey said that P-Patches have to be in locations that get six 

        full hours of sunlight and are at least 6,000 square feet.  All gardening 

        must be organic.  She said that it was best to be on a relatively quiet 

        street and also if the patch was big enough to accommodate a tool shed 

        and compost bin.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>No 

        Business Representative Report</u>:  </b>Jan Brucker, who was originally 

        scheduled to give a Business Report was absent due to her daughter’s participation 

        in a play.  Jan hoped to e-mail her report to members.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>OLD 

        BUSINESS:</u></b></font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>Friends 

        of Pillings Pond</u></b>:  Bob Messina gave a recap of the history of 

        the committee and the community interest in preserving the Pillings Pond 

        and said its members were Yvonne Zoretic, Debra Willendorf, Wanda Fullner, 

        and himself.  The Council will be receiving a $10,000.00 grant from a 

        fund maintained by Councilwoman Cynthia Sullivan.  Bob said that the Land 

        Conservancy is willing to do a free appraisal of the property.  There 

        is large support for preserving the site and several meetings have already 

        been held and tours conducted to give people in different departments 

        of the City a first-hand look at the property.  Bob said that an article 

        will be written for the March Newsletter (written by Debra).  Help is 

        needed for (1) a Stewardship Committee (Chuck Pillings is 89 years old 

        and needs some help); (2) Historical Committee; and (3) Meeting/Publicity 

        Committee.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We next watched 

        a short video interview of Chuck Pillings.  It appeared on television 

        in the late 80’s and was brought by Yvonne.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>Wilson-Pacific 

        Master Plan</u></b>:  Liz said that a Master Plan should be/will be done 

        for the Wilson site, including Pillings Pond and the playfields.  Phil 

        Fuji is working with us on this and all players are invited to participate.  

        Cynthia Sullivan is on our side, but the School Board needs to get on 

        our side.  Liz planned that a School District representative would be 

        invited to an upcoming meeting in early April.  A meeting will take place 

        tomorrow to draft a letter to be sent to all “players” regarding the LSCC’s 

        wish list and to determine possible public meeting dates.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>North 

        Precinct</u>:</b>  John Meerscheidt gave a police activity report.  He 

        said that the police had recently conducted an undercover sting on Aurora 

        Avenue to address the prostitution activity going on.  The police are 

        attempting to get the cooperation of the motel owners to police themselves.  

        He also mentioned that a “john school” was being set up since it has been 

        successful in other areas and arrested customers of prostitutes can choose 

        “school” in lieu of jail.  Also, Captain Cindy Caldwell is being transferred.  

        We do not know at this time who the new Police Captain will be, but they 

        will arrive in April.  Auto prowls are up in the North Precinct.  Sonia 

        Richter is the Northeast Section Contact for block watch.  John said that 

        she would be invited to a future meeting.  John also reminded us that 

        the Police Department will do home surveys to help citizens know what 

        to do to make their homes safer.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>Past 

        Board Member</u>:  </b>Ellen gave greetings from Randy Elder, past Board 

        member who still wants to know what is going on with us.  Randy said he 

        would send out an e-mail when Jeanette has given birth to their first 

        child.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>North 

        Park</u>:</b>  Edie Whitsett gave a report on the Mineral Springs/North 

        Park project.  This park is to get funding from the Parks for All levy 

        that was passed.  The park is due to receive $700,000 at some time within 

        the next eight years.  Since this funding is off in the future, Edie said 

        that the committee was considering applying for matching funds to be able 

        to have the plant survey done.  She said that an event was planned for 

        June&nbsp;30<sup>th</sup> that was open to the community.  There would 

        be art projects and everyone would be encouraged to participate.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The netting, 

        that has been designed for safety reasons and is to be installed at the 

        southern end of the park, was discussed.  Edie said that the netting has 

        been funded through the Emergency Response Fund (since the barrier was 

        needed because of safety concerns).  The design plan for the netting still 

        has to go through core review at the Parks Department, and, at this point 

        only one third of the netting will be installed, to see how it works and 

        what more would be needed.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Belinda Gigliotti 

        explained that the Parks for All levy money was first being spent on acquisition 

        and then on projects that were ready to go ahead.  She said that groups 

        are encouraged to get started on their projects.  Edie explained that 

        we are in a tough spot because the next thing we need is construction 

        drawings ($50,000.00) and it is nearly impossible for us to raise enough 

        cash to match the cash needed.  We also need an arborist study of the 

        park.  Jenny Benz volunteered to talk with Mark Mead.  If we could get 

        a vegetation study, we could begin further work at the park.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>Northgate</u>:</b>  

        Bob Messina said that he has heard that Intercorp Company is now ready 

        to “jump in.”  Also, Richard Conlin is now in favor of daylighting.  It 

        was noted that Simon still has the Master Plan to develop the north portion 

        of the mall.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bert Bradley 

        reported on the recent Greenwood Community meeting that he had attended.  

        Folks there are discussing Kroger plans for the Fred Meyer site redevelopment 

        near 85<sup>th</sup> and Greenwood.  He said that our meetings were much 

        calmer!</font></p>
