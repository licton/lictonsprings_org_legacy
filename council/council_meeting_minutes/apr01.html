      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President 

        Liz Kearns called the meeting to order at 7:05 p.m. and everyone introduced 

        themselves. At this point we were waiting for Jerry to bring up Captain 

        Oliver when he arrived.</font></p>

        The March 21, 2001 meeting minutes were approved as presented.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At this point, 

        Jerry Owens arrived with Captain Dan Oliver and we again went around the 

        table introducing ourselves.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW BUSINESS:</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Liz Kearns 

        introduced Captain Oliver and highlighted the concerns of the community, 

        focusing on the area in and around Licton Springs Park and the area around 

        90th and Aurora. She asked the Captain to tell us something about himself 

        and the North Precinct.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain Dan 

        Oliver said that he had lived in this area, up near 82nd and Aurora, for 

        15 to 16 years when he was young. He said that he had gone to Blanchet 

        High School. He said that the focus at the North Precinct was on the criminal 

        activity on Aurora and the one block area east and west of Aurora. He 

        told us that senior (wounded, having served time in prison) members of 

        the Blood and Cryps gangs from California had moved into the area between 

        78th and 90th on Aurora. He noted that the California &quot;market&quot; 

        was saturated and so it was natural for these individuals to move north 

        on the I-5 corridor in order to expand their market. This area of Aurora 

        is good for them because of the many cheap motels and low-rent apartments. 

        These individuals are hardened gang members who have tried to intimidate 

        police officers and their families. Captain Oliver told us not to confront 

        these gangsters. He said the Precinct had begun a walking beat with officers 

        patrolling both sides of Aurora from 85th to 90th and also Nesbit Place.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain Oliver 

        said that the Police Department does not have the resources to be everywhere. 

        Because of the criminal activity, the focus now is on Aurora. If we had 

        other concerns, he asked that we make them known.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Captain 

        advised anyone with a Honda or Toyota model car/van not to park it on 

        the street. He said the seats in these types of vehicles are very valuable 

        and if your car is easily accessible, you run the risk of having your 

        car/van stripped. Sonja Richter advised everyone to park their car in 

        their garage and lock it!</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sonja Richter 

        next gave some statistics for our area, which has 7,154 residences (and 

        over 14,000 residents) for the 12 months of the year 2000: 11 residential 

        burglaries, 56 auto thefts, one rape, 10 robberies, and one arson.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">She urged 

        us to be careful where we placed items around our homes. Do not place 

        flammable liquid, combustible materials close to our homes. Arsonists 

        do not carry around the materials to make fires, but take advantage of 

        what's left around by residents.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">She said 

        that a common crime right now is identity theft. She urged us to be careful 

        with paperwork that we put into our recycling bin and/or garbage. We need 

        to obliterate personal information to guard our identity.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">She said 

        that two block watches had combined to form the Aurora &amp; 90th Group. 

        These people plan to walk the blocks of Aurora, with their dogs, and &quot;take 

        back the streets&quot; from the gang types. They will be totally non-confrontational. 

        They will be walking on May 3rd and May 15th.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sonja also 

        mentioned that she does free home security checks. People should call 

        her at 684-7717 to schedule an appointment. She said that she gives recommendations 

        in the home security checks on what can be done to make the home more 

        secure.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Liz asked 

        if Licton Springs had a Community Service Officer at present. Captain 

        Oliver said that we did. Liz will go to the Precinct tomorrow with information 

        about our April 30 meeting and at the same time get the name of our CSO.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kenna Heginbottom, 

        HOST Project of Downtown Emergency Service Center: Kenna Heginbottom is 

        an Outreach and Engagement Specialist with the HOST Project (Homeless 

        Outreach Stabilization and Transition). Her territory is the North Precinct 

        plus north to the county line. She can provide full-service mental health 

        services, and is trying to reach people who have chosen to live outside 

        the system, i.e., on their own, outside, without medication, rejecting 

        help from the system. These people reject most help, no matter how it 

        is offered. Kenna tries to develop a trusted relationship with these individuals 

        over time and help them (even when people don't have an address or want 

        to give their name). Kenna said that if we noticed homeless or mentally 

        ill, non-functional people in our neighborhood, she is the person to call 

        (as long as they are not doing something illegal). Her contact information 

        is:</font></p>

        Pager: 464-6454<br>

        Fax: 652-1236.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kenna also 

        told us that she can present a training session on homeless people and/or 

        mentally ill people. These sessions last an hour and are educational/informative 

        for members of the community and will help them understand homeless or 

        mentally ill people better.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Community 

        Meeting, April 30, 2001: Next, Liz turned the meeting over to Bob Messina. 

        Agendas and purpose statements were distributed. Then a discussion followed 

        about setting up for the April 30 community meeting at Wilson-Pacific. 

        Tasks needing to be done were outlined and volunteers lined up. Jan Avinger-Jacques 

        recommended that we have &quot;talking points&quot; written down containing 

        the items/questions we wanted to have addressed/answered. Bob thought 

        that the premise of the meeting already required the officials who would 

        be present to stay on point, but it was agreed that folks could e-mail 

        Jan (duramater4@yahoo.com) with their &quot;points&quot; and she would 

        compile a list and have it copied for Board/community members. Wally Fosmore 

        said that we should obtain the School Site Strategic Plan, and ask questions 

        based on that document. He said that we should be able to obtain a copy 

        of that plan. Belinda Gigliotti suggested that we be sure and raise the 

        question of &quot;to whom should we direct concerns that come out of this 

        meeting.&quot;</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bob emphasized 

        that this community meeting is an excellent opportunity to bring all issues 

        we have to the table at one time to the various organizations.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bert Bradley 

        suggested that having written comments sheets available was a good idea 

        and offered to provide them. He said he would also review them after the 

        meeting and compile a report regarding same.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bob said 

        that we would ask for an Advisory Committee to be formed as a result of 

        this meeting.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">North Seattle 

        Community College. Wally Fosmore said the NSCC had just completed interviews 

        with five applicants interested in serving as President of North Seattle 

        Community College. He said that one of these applicants would be offered 

        the presidency and would start serving on July 1st.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wilson-Pacific 

        Ball Field Improvements: Bob Messina said that he had attended the first 

        steering meeting on the ball fields. He told us that there will be no 

        surprises. They showed different configurations for the playing fields 

        and it will be possible to have two softball fields (one 90' field; one 

        60' field); or a soccer field with softball field; or football field with 

        softball field. He said that there were plans to have berms with flowers 

        and bench areas where the tennis courts are now. He said there would be 

        no bleachers by the playing fields. There would be restrooms at the northwest 

        end. He said there would be no cement parking spaces and the parking area 

        was located at the north end. He said that they were going to include 

        a walking path around the perimeter. Bob said that there were steering 

        committee did have public meetings scheduled for May 1st, May 8th and 

        May 28th. Our community meeting, which will include a focus on the playing 

        field is not counted as a play field public meeting.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Northgate: 

        Jeanne Muir passed out &quot;An Open Letter to the Northgate Area Communities 

        From Security Properties&quot; dated April 2001. She also had flyers for 

        Compost Bin Days (April 28 and 29) at the south parking lot at Northgate.</font></p>
