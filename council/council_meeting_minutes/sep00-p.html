      <h4>Minutes of Board Meeting:  September&nbsp;20, 2000, NSCC President’s 

        Board Room</h4>

      <p><u>Present</u>:  Liz Kearns, Jerry Owens, Randy Elder, Bob Messina, Wanda 

        Fullner, Debra Willendorf, Jan Brucker, and Ellen Beck.</p>

      <p><u>Absent</u>:  John Meerscheidt and Sheryl Stich.</p>

      <p><u>Visitors</u>:  Stuart Ling, Martin and Laila Grassley, Harve LaVelle, 

        Kathleen Warren (Pro Parks), and Don Svetich (Aurora Avenue property owner).</p>

      <p>President Liz Kearns called the meeting to order at 7:05 p.m., and those 

        present introduced themselves.</p>

      <p><b><u>Minutes</u>:  </b>The June 21, 2000 meeting minutes were approved 

        as presented.</p>

      <p>Liz announced that Randy Elder was resigning as Treasurer.  It was moved 

        by Randy Elder, seconded by Jerry Owens, and unanimously passed by the 

        Board that Debra Willendorf be elected Treasurer, effective immediately.  

        Debra agreed to take the office.  Thank you, Debra!</p>

      <p><b><u>Treasurer’s Report</u></b>:  Liz Kearns gave the Treasurer’s Report.  

        Licton Springs Community Council has a balance of $446.14.</p>

      <p><b><u>Community Picnic</u>: </b> A review was given by Liz of the annual 

        picnic, and then group discussion followed.  It was felt that the food 

        was removed too early.  People arriving just after 1:00 p.m. received 

        no food.  This has not been the case at our previous picnics and the consensus 

        was that this early removal of the food was unsatisfactory and must have 

        been due to a misunderstanding.  The children’s games were a great success, 

        as was the Bubble Man.  The band was enjoyed, but Liz felt the $400.00 

        cost was too high.  Liz said she welcomed other music suggestions that 

        anyone had.</p>

      <p>The cost of the picnic was $623.53.  Wanda Fullner said that she would 

        check this cost against our budget and report back to us.</p>

      <h3>Pro Parks/Parks for All<span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:

none'>:</span><span>  </span>Kathleen Warren told us about the history of this 

        project.  She showed us a map of the City with all the locations of the 

        park projects noted, and also had several handouts for us.  She told us 

        that the $200 Million raised would be allocated as follows:  Opportunity 

        Fund - $10 Million; Purchase of New Sites Fund - $26 Million; Development 

        Fund - $102 Million; and Maintenance and Programming Fund - $61 Million.</h3>

      <p>A question and answer session followed Kathleen’s presentation.  If this 

        levy passes, our North Park project will get much needed funding.  Liz 

        noted that Edie Whitsett supported Pro Parks and was organizing a phone 

        bank and would welcome volunteers.  Kathleen Warren asked if our group 

        would formally endorse Parks for All.  Wanda Fullner moved and Jerry Owens 

        seconded that we endorse Parks for All.  Discussion followed.  Randy Elder 

        said he opposed the proposition because it was too broad sweeping and 

        there were other departments (i.e., police department) that needed increased 

        funding.  A vote was taken and the motion passed (six approving; two against; 

        three abstaining).</p>

      <p><b><u>North Precinct</u>:</b>  Randy Elder gave a report on the North 

        Precinct.  He said that anyone was welcome to attend the first Wednesday 

        of each month 7:00 p.m. meetings held at the North Precinct.  Chief of 

        Police Gil Kerlikowske will speak at the October meeting.</p>

      <p><b><u>School District Meeting</u>:  </b>Liz Kearns announced that Seattle 

        School Superintendant Joseph Olchefskie and/or John Richmond would be 

        at a meeting Thursday, September&nbsp;28<sup>th</sup>, to be held at NOAA, 

        1801 Fairview.  Liz urged anyone interested to attend this meeting.  LSCC 

        wants to keep on the forefront our concerns about the Wilson-Pacific School 

        site.</p>

      <p><b><u>North Park</u>:</b>  Liz reported that Edie Whitsett had submitted 

        a Matching Fund Application on September&nbsp;18<sup>th</sup>.  The application 

        was for $20,000.00, to be matched with $25,405.00, for a grand total of 

        $45,405.00.  This money would be used for Phase I:  completing the site 

        survey, developing a forest/vegetation management plan and creating an 

        arts plan.</p>

      <p>Liz said there would be a fundraising workshop Monday, October 23<sup>rd</sup>, 

        from 6:00 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.  Everyone is welcome.  Contact Edie or Liz 

        for more information.</p>

      <p><b><u>Historical Project</u>:</b>  Liz reported on the Historical Project 

        since the head of our Historical Committee, John Labovitz, is vacationing 

        in Europe.  The Committee has chosen Mimi Sheridan and Carol Tobin to 

        help us with our historical pamphlet/book.  We are fortunate to have two 

        such talented ladies working for us.  Liz said that she and Debra Willendorf 

        would be meeting the following morning to work on the contract to be executed 

        by LSCC and our consultants.</p>

      <p><b><u>Neighborhood Break-in</u>:</b>  Stuart Ling, a neighbor who has 

        lived at 1626 – 100<sup>th</sup> in Licton Springs for the past three 

        years, told about a robbery that had occurred on Septem­ber&nbsp;5<sup>th</sup> 

        while he was on vacation.  He said it was the one day that his sisters 

        were not there and so he thought his residence was being watched.  Small 

        items were taken from his home, plus his car was stolen.  He was most 

        concerned about checks that had been stolen and cashed at various local 

        banks on the same day.  He was going to attempt to view the surveillance 

        tapes of the banks and inquired about running a notice/picture in our 

        newsletter.  Jan Brucker advised that this was not a proper step for LSCC 

        to take since it opened us up for causes of action (i.e., slander) since 

        everyone is presumed innocent until proven guilty.</p>

      <p><b><u>Zoning Presentation</u>:</b>  Don Svetich, a property owner on 

        the west side of Aurora (946 – 103<sup>rd</sup>), made a presentation 

        to the group.  He recounted with the help of charts and pictures the background 

        for his request to the City for rezoning and his experiences.  Those present 

        were supportive for his proposed zoning change.  It was suggested that 

        Phil Fuji would be a good person for Mr. Svetich to talk to, since he 

        is with the Department of Neighborhoods for our part of the City (and 

        what Mr. Svetich is seeking to do conforms with our recommendations in 

        our Neighborhood Plan), and if Phil cannot help him, perhaps he can refer 

        him to someone who could be of assistance.</p>

      <p><b><u>Northgate</u>:  </b>Jan Brucker announced that the south lot of 

        Northgate has been put up for sale by Simon Properties!  Jan said that 

        the City was considering purchasing the property.</p>

      <p>The meeting was adjourned at 9:15 p.m.</p>

      <p>Respectfully submitted,</p>

      <p>Ellen M. Beck</p>

      <p>Secretary</p>
