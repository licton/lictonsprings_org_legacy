                until 10:00 p.m.&nbsp; Tom said he and Melissa had done an expanded

                Night Out, inviting neighbors on neighboring streets.&nbsp; They

                had a large turnout, great food, and considered it a huge success.&nbsp; Debra

                      Kearns gave a history of Halloween in the Park, which happens

                      on the day from 4:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.&nbsp; It is geared

                      for young trick-or-treaters with  &ldquo;Friends of the

                      Park&rdquo; stationed around the

                Licton Springs Park to give treats to the youngsters.&nbsp; Betsy

                Weill organizes her friends and arranges for music.&nbsp; Betsy

                runs a daycare and spends a lot of time with the children in

                the Park.&nbsp; We obtain donations in order to buy candy and

                obtain organic apple juice, and pay for the music.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ellen

                  Beck reported that she had spoken with Betsy, and PDF&rsquo;ed

                the request for donation letters (sent to the Northgate QFC,

                Greenwood Fred Meyer, Puget Consumer Co-Op PCC, SAM&rsquo;s Club,

                Roosevelt Safeway) to Betsy.&nbsp;&nbsp; She suggested we should

                also ask the HT Oaktree Market for a donation.&nbsp; A letter

                was prepared to the Market, mailed today, and also PDF&rsquo;ed

                to Betsy, who said she would go around seeking the donations,

                and also contact her &ldquo;Friends of the Forest.&rdquo;</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ellen

                  said that Costco, who has donated to us in the past, said this

                  year that our request had not been timely.&nbsp;  So, we

                will not be receiving a donation from them. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Liz reported that PCC has said they will again donate the organic

                apple juice!</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Debra

                  reported that we annually received about $100.00 in donations

                on Halloween night.&nbsp; The music for the evening costs $50.00.&nbsp; The

                candy cost is estimated by Betsy to be $1.00 per child, or $300.00.&nbsp; Debra

                said Halloween in the Park was budgeted for $223.00.&nbsp; We

                also have budgeted $500.00 for the picnic, which we no longer

                have.&nbsp; Everyone agreed that we would be able to fund Halloween

                in the Park, no matter what donations we received or failed to

                receive.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Liz

                  commented that last year Shannon Snider&rsquo;s father sent

                us a box of candy.&nbsp; She said she would talk to Shannon and

                see if we could receive something this year, too.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tom

                  questioned whether our event could be sponsored by, i.e., Barnes  &amp; Noble.&nbsp; Liz

                said the Parks Department could have a problem with that.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tom suggested that we should/could approach the Northgate commercial

                interests about general grants (annual may be possible) to the

                community for use on all program areas (mailers, public meetings,

                newsletter costs, translations services, events, etc.).</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ellen

                  said that it was a great idea, though, to contact the new stores

                  at Northgate (Barnes &amp; Noble, Ram Restaurant,

                Stanford Restaurant, the new bakery, etc.) regarding donations

                for next year&rsquo;s event.</font></p>

                  Task Force</b><br>

                  &nbsp; Liz said that there was not

                enough information at this time to report.&nbsp; The group was

                formed because of the Viewlands School being closed and concern

                that the building would be sold.&nbsp; Debra told of attending

                their initial meeting, which she said was mainly brainstorming.&nbsp; Liz

                said she would give a report at the October meeting.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Diversity</b><br>

                There

                  was a discussion about diversity.&nbsp; Because

                of the increase in residents in our community and a percentage

                of the new residents having English as a second language, it

                was wondered if we could have our Newsletter and other announcements

                translated.&nbsp; Liz volunteered to contact Beth Pflug, who

                is the Northwest District Coordinator.</font></p>

                  Meeting</b><br>

                Liz reported on reserving the North Star Dining Room

                for our upcoming meetings.&nbsp; Because of the

                third Wednesday in November falling so close to Thanksgiving,

                  the November meeting reservation was made for November 14th,

                  the second Wednesday.&nbsp; It was agreed that we needed to

                  inform people of this change, and then remind them, that is,

                  get the word out twice!&nbsp; It should also be posted on the

                  LSCC website. </font></div>

                  Serve</b><br>

                Kathleen Braden reported that she has gone through the

                e-mail addresses in the List Serve and eliminated duplications.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Discussion was then had regarding advantages of using an e-mail

                address that links back to our website, i.e., <a href="mailto:info@lictonsprings.org">info@lictonsprings.org</a>.&nbsp; If

                our server afforded us a number of e-mail addresses, we could

                have them bounce from the server to the <a href="mailto:lictonsprings@hotmail.com">lictonsprings@hotmail.com</a> account.&nbsp; Suggestions

                were going back and forth between Tom, Kathleen, and Kelly.&nbsp;  Debra

                suggested that the rest of us would defer to whatever they decided,

                since we didn&rsquo;t understand the issues to the degree that

                Tom, Kathleen, and Kelly do.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There

                  was a question of who at the College to ask questions about

                  the server that could not be answered.&nbsp; It was decided

                that Amy Markishtum, who takes care of our website, would have

                that information.&nbsp; Debra informed us that the committee

                meeting to discuss updating the website (Janice Lichtenwaldt,

                Debra, Kathleen Braden, and Kay Mesirow) would meet on Monday,

                September 24th, and Amy would also be participating.&nbsp; Debra

                agreed to get the name of the person at NSCC from Amy at the

                meeting.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We

                  again discussed frequency of e-mails to the List Serve and

                  Kelly again mentioned that his wife Janice works for Expedia

                and their marketing person would be happy to come to one of our

                meetings and give us information and tips.&nbsp; It was acknowledged

                that we do not send too many messages to our List Serve

                members.&nbsp; It was decided that this could be on our agenda

                for October&rsquo;s meeting.&nbsp; Kelly agreed to let Janice

                know so that it can be set up.</font></p>

                Albiani gave an update of her efforts to get a P&#8209;Patch

                started in Licton Springs.&nbsp; She said that she had made many

                contacts, but had not had responses back.&nbsp; She has talked

                with Rich McDonald and to Wilson Pacific representatives and

                folks at Licton Springs Park.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kathleen

                  had learned of concerns of the Friends of the Park for locating

                  the P-Patch at Licton Springs Park.&nbsp; The Friends

                were concerned about the fertilizers that would be used and how

                having the P-Patch located there would affect their efforts to

                keep only native species in the Park.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kathleen

                  said the head gardener at NSCC was interested and also a teacher

                  (who gardens at Interbay).&nbsp; The college location

                discussed is at the south end, between the tennis courts and

                parking lot.&nbsp; It is a high location, so it would drain well,

                and it would receive a lot of sun.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Liz volunteered to contact Dave Barber regarding finding any

                City-owned land in our neighborhood that might be a possible

                P-Patch location.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kelly

                  suggested also considering non-traditional locations, i.e.,

                  using the rooftop of a parking facility for a garden location.&nbsp;  It&rsquo;s

                good to think outside the box!</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kelly

                  also has a friend in TILT and would see what information he
