Pedestrian/Bike Bridge</U></FONT><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">. 
Art Brochet, City of Seattle Department of Transportation
Communications Lead gave a short history of the need for a pedestrian
bridge across Interstate 5.  King County did a study to determine if
there was a need/interest for a pedestrian bridge.  The Urban Design
Workshop showed interest.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Possible
designs for the bridge were discussed; nothing is final yet.  The
challenge now is how to design the drop down from the bridge to the
ground on both sides of I-5, which must be ADA accessible.  The
design should be complete by fall 2014; looking to build by 2021 when
the Northgate Light Rail Station opens, or earlier – depending on
funding.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">SDOT
gives the following benefits of the project:  (1) providing a better
connection for students and transit users to North Seattle Community
College; increasing ridership at the King County Transit Center and
future Light Rail Station; developing a new connection between the
east and west sides of I-5 in Northgate; and providing important
access for bicyclists and pedestrians in the Northgate vicinity.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">The
funding has a $25 million planning budget.  A TIGER grant of $15
million is needed to combine with the $5 million each being provided
by Sound Transit and the Seattle Department of Transportation.  The
deadline to obtain full funding is July 31, 2015.  If $25 million is
not in hand at that time, the Sound Transit portion will be used for
other pedestrian and bicycle improvements in the area.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><U>Smoke
Free Campus</U></FONT><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">.  Javier
Rodriquez, NSCC work study student, spoke about the proposed Smoke
Free Campus idea.  He feels that the smoking students will be forced
to smoke in the neighborhood if the policy is adopted.  With no
ashtrays available, they will pollute the neighborhood, and, thus
disrupt relations between the college and its neighbors.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">His
suggestion is to have two designated on-campus smoking areas:  one at
the south end and one at the north end of campus.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">The

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><U>Pedestrian
Zones</U></FONT><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">.  Aly Pennucci,
Senior Planner for the Seattle Department of Planning and Development
spoke to us about the Aurora-Licton Pedestrian Zone mapping project. 
The Pedestrian Zone survey closed on April 30, 2014.  They are still
reviewing the results.  So far the community response was positive
and the AMA response was not.  The City Council mapped 60 areas –
and added two additional areas, one of those was Licton Springs. 
They felt the Pedestrian Zone recognition was needed in the Licton
Springs commercial area along Aurora Avenue.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">The
Pedestrian Zone is used to promote walkable commercial areas with
certain criteria for buildings and businesses within the zone. 
Existing businesses can remain “as is” but if a business is
vacant for one year, then the new rules would apply to the new
owner’s development of the business.</FONT></P>
