          Minutes of Community Meeting, October 21, 2009,<br>

          NSCC Conference Room 2311 </p>

        <p align="left">Directors Present: <br>

          Liz Kearns, Jerry Owens, Tom Meyer, Kay Mesirow, and Ellen Beck. </p>

        <p align="left">Board Representatives Present: <br>

          Ken Thompson (North Precinct Representative). </p>

        <p align="left">Visitors: <br>

          Jean Wirch. </p>

        <p align="left">Board Member Liz Kearns called the meeting to order at 7:00 p.m. </p>

        <p align="left">Ellen Beck announced that she had received an e-mail from Kathleen Braden, who wanted us to know that she had committed to a social justice education program at her church for eight consecutive Wednesday evenings. She wanted us to know that, although she will miss meetings, she is able to do her listserv duties. Ellen also had heard from Kathy Package, who has been with us the last meetings. She is sick tonight</p>

        <p align="left">Minutes: <br>

          The September 16, 2009 minutes were approved as presented. </p>

        <p align="left">There was no Treasurer&rsquo;s Report. As there had been no Treasurer&rsquo;s Report for the September meeting, Liz said she would follow up with Debra Willendorf. </p>

        <p align="left"><b>OLD BUSINESS:</b> </p>

        <p align="left">Halloween 2009<br>

          Halloween at the Park will be from 4:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. People were urged to attend as the event is fun for adults as well as kids. Anyone wanting to donate candy, should drop it off at Betsy&rsquo;s house. </p>

        <p align="left">The children trick-or-treat around the pond.<br>

          This year they will be going to nine &ldquo;stations&rdquo; where the Friends of the Forest have goodies for them. Live music will be provided, which Liz has volunteered to pay for, to a maximum of $50.00. There will be hot apple cider for the kids. PCC has donated eight gallons of apple juice! </p>

        <p align="left">The PCC $25.00 gift card was discussed. Since Halloween is on Saturday this year, Liz said the card could be used to buy more apple juice, and perhaps jack-o-lanterns. </p>

        <p align="left">North Precinct<br>

          Ken Thompson reported that the monthly meeting had gone well. The candidates for mayor had both been invited. Mike McGinn had come, but Joe Mallahan had a family emergency and therefore sent a representative in his place. </p>

        <p align="left">Land Use<br> 

          Tom Meyer had nothing new to report. With his computer down he hadn&rsquo;t been able to do his usual amount of monitoring, but there has not been much activity for many months. </p>

        <p>Liz reported on the home at 97th and Densmore that an electrician has purchased. He has turned the home into a triplex and has two renters living there, plus himself. Liz said she has talked to him about the illegality of what he has done.</p>

        <p> <b>NEW BUSINESS: </b></p>

        <p>Corporate Matters and Revision of Bylaws<br>

          Liz passed out copies of our LSCC Bylaws and, on blue paper, amendments that were proposed in the past. It was agreed that the amendments should be incorporated into the Bylaws. Since no one had access to a computer version of the original Bylaws, Tom volunteered to take the Bylaws and amendments to Mailboxes to inquire if they can be scanned. Liz said she would call Mailboxes ahead of Tom&rsquo;s going there to alert them that he would be coming on behalf of LSCC. Tom will then take the scanned Bylaws and amendments on a disk to Ellen, who will then create the Amended Bylaws. </p>

        <p>Ellen reported on the Conflict of Interest Policy she had created from the example in Appendix A to IRS Form 1023. The Policy was then e-mailed to Board members in advance of the meeting. Tom&rsquo;s home computer did not allow him to access the Policy, so a hard copy was given to him to review. <br>

        </p>

        <p>At this time Jerry Owens formally moved, and Kay Mesirow seconded, that the Licton Springs Community Council seek 501(c)(3) status and adopt the Conflict of Interest Policy presented. This motion passed unanimously. </p>

        <p>Kay reported that her employer encouraged volunteerism and matches volunteer hours with a donation to a 501(c)(3) organization. Because Pilling&rsquo;s Pond has 501(c)(3) status, they have benefited from her volunteer hours working on the E-Currents. She said she will happily have LSCC benefit for those hours once we have qualified for 501(c)(3) status. </p>

        <p>Northwest District Council<br>

          Jerry reported on the Northwest District Council. They meet the fourth Wednesday of the month at the Greenwood Community Service Center, 8515 Greenwood Avenue North. The meetings begin at 7:00 p.m. and are open to the public. He said that the NWDC had just revised their Bylaws regarding membership. It is now time to elect a new principal representative and backup to attend meetings. He agreed to continue as the LSCC representative, and Liz agreed to be Jerry&rsquo;s backup. She said she has attended meetings in the past and that they are interesting and informative. Jerry said that NWDC gets guest speakers from City government, the Seattle City Council, City Light, etc. The Northwest District Council is a good vehicle for communities to get the word out about their programs and activities and is a good resource for communities. </p>

        <p>Northgate Stakeholders Group<br> 

          Jerry talked about the stakeholder group that he has participated in. The group includes five to six representatives and this is the group that has looked at the rezoning of the Northgate overlay area. Development will happen, but there is a need for &ldquo;green&rdquo; streets that welcome walkers and bikers. He reported that developers had &ldquo;backed off&rdquo; unlimited height. </p>

        <p>Wrap-Up. We had a general discussion of the neighborhood, economy, City, and the country! </p>

        <p>Our next meeting is Wednesday, November 18, 2009. </p>

        <p>The meeting adjourned at 8:30 p.m. </p>

        <p>Respectfully submitted, </p>

        <p>Ellen M. Beck, Secretary <br>

            <br>
