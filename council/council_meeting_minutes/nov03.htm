          report showed our available bank balance is $1,343.65. There was a discussion 

          of Halloween costs. JJ Avinger-Jacques said she would try to get more 

          donated from Costco next year. Betsy Weill has asked for a card table 

          and another water cooler for next year. It was suggested that Betsy 

          use the money donated at the event for these. Liz Kearns will talk with 

          Betsy and report back to the Board.<br>

          helped with our Halloween event and the History House display. Liz and 

          Wanda will get those names and addresses to Ellen. Also, it was felt

          and Andrew Schmidt for all their help over the years. </font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Sidewalks 

          for 100th Street:</strong> Trung Pham (Seattle Department of Transportation, 

          &#8220;SDOT&#8221;) spoke about alternative sidewalks for 100th Street. 

          He was unable to tell us the budget but said he would find out. He had 

          a rough survey of 100th Street from Aurora to Meridian, which shows 

          drop-off in some sections. He said that drainage issues could run the 

          cost up to $100,000.00 and make it too costly a project. There was much 

          discussion of where exactly the sidewalk would be and what material 

          would be used for construction, and costs, costs, costs. Mr. Pham was 

          looking at sidewalks on the south side of 100th Street from Ashworth 

          East for probably two blocks, since that was all the money available. 

          We urged him to consider the north side from Meridian to Densmore as 

          this section is the most dangerous and the north side is less sloped. 

          He will study that idea and let us know what is feasible.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We also discussed eliminating parking on 

          part or all of 100th Street, traffic calming devises, and the possibility 

          of additional funding from Seattle Public Utilities. Mr. Pham will attend 

          our January meeting and have more information at that time.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Pilling&#8217;s 

          Pond:</strong> Wanda Fullner reported that things are okay right now. 

          The pond did experience some flooding during the record breaking rain 

          in October. Pilling&#8217;s Pond Preservation Committee (&#8220;PPP&#8221;) 

          has a promise of $20,000.00 from Cynthia Sullivan and Wanda has been 

          advised that she should secure this with Bob Ferguson, who will take 

          over Cynthia&#8217;s office on January 1, 2004. Wanda is trying to reach 

          Mr. Ferguson now.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Also, it now looks like the Seattle School 

          District did not lay bypass pipes under the new playing fields. The 

          pipes were to move runoff water away from Pilling&#8217;s Pond. Wanda 

          will verify this and talk with the School District.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An 

          easement agreement is being drafted now. Next, an appraiser will value 

          the easement and then PPP will review it.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Neighborhood Priorities We agreed with 

          the same priorities listed last month. Liz will complete the paperwork 

          and Jerry will submit it at the Northwest District Counsel meeting on 

          December 10th.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Aurora 

          Traffic:</strong> Bert Bradley spoke with Teresa Casper of SDOT about 

          the parking being eliminated from Aurora Avenue and the Aurora Merchants 

          Association (&#8220;AMA&#8221;) lawsuit. Ms. Casper said that the new 

          parking arrangements are now in place and there have been no complaints 

          so far. These changes are an attempt to improve the flow of traffic 

          on Aurora Avenue and businesses hat have lost parking due to these changes 

          have been given additional parking space around the corner (off of Aurora). 

          The LSCC Board was in general agreement that we will not join the AMA 

          lawsuit, at this time.</font><br>
