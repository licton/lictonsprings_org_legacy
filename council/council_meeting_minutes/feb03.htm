        know 

        the

        Bert 

        said 

        that 

        guidelines 

        have 

        to 

        work 

        towards 

        preserving 

        what 

        is 

        unique 

        in 

        your 

        neighborhood.  

        Since 

        we 

        have 

        a 

        near 

        impossible 

        task

        engaging 

        the 

        merchants 

        along 

        Aurora 

        and 

        we 

        don’t 

        really 

        have 

        “unique 

        architecture” 

        in 

        the 

        neighborhood, 

        it 

        would 

        be 

        difficult 

        for 

        us 

        to 

        qualify 

        for 

        establishing 

        design 

        guidelines.  

        What 

        we 

        can 

        do 

        is 

        attend 

        the 

        hearings 

        of 

        the 

        DCLU.  

        These 

        are 

        held 

        at

        Office 

        at 

        85<sup>th</sup> 

        and 

        Dayton.  

        The 

        hearings 

        take 

        place 

        once 

        every 

        couple 

        months 

        or 

        so.  

        Bert

        that 

        he 

        was 

        trying

        figure 

        out 

        how 

        to

        notice 

        of 

        the 

        hearings.  

        Discussion 

        followed.  

        It 

        was 

        pointed 

        out 

        that 

        the 

        person 

        attending

        on 

        behalf 

        of
