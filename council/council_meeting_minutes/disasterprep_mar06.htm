              NSCC Student Cafeteria </B></FONT></P>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> At 7:05 p.m., Kay Mesirow opened this special meeting of the

                Licton Springs Community Council, welcoming everyone. There were

                45-50 neighbors present. Kay noted that census bureau information

                tells us that 10,000 people live in the Licton Springs community.

                She therefore asked those at the meeting to spread the word with

                their neighbors and friends. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Next

                  she introduced Diane Horswell of the Seattle Police Department.

                  Diane is a member of SDART &ndash; Seattle Disaster Aid &amp; Response

                Team. She provided everyone in attendance with Getting Ready

              . . . SDART&rsquo;s guide to Personal &amp; Neighborhood Preparedness. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Earthquakes</b> Diane

                  spoke about the world and national disasters of the recent

                  past. What we in Seattle need to prepare for is earthquake

                  damage. She said our last big earthquake, which was five years

                  ago, originated from the Nisqually fault line and was centered

                  south of Olympia. In the Seattle area, we are most concerned

                  about the Seattle fault. The areas most at risk are West Seattle

                  and Magnolia because of their topography. Over time, the pattern

                  of the Seattle fault has been to cause a notable earthquake

                  ever 25 years. Seattle experienced Seattle fault earthquakes

              in 1949 and in 1965. We are now long overdue.<a href="disasterprep_mar06.htm#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a></font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But earthquakes in our area are most survivable if you prepare.

                Houses here, with the exception of brick homes, do not collapse.

                There are steps we can take to curb damage. It is important for

                households to have provisions to allow them to get by for at

              least 72 hours or until normalization. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Tsunami </b>A question was raised on tsunami danger. Diane said that

                  we would not be affected by any tsunamis here because Puget

                  Sound is an inside body of water. Cities and towns on the Washington

                  coast, however, are susceptible to tsunami danger. A tsunami

                  here would be caused by a fault in the Pacific Ocean. Earthquakes

                  originating there are very powerful &ndash; in the 9 range &ndash; and

                last for ten to 15 minutes. Unfortunately we have no gauge on

                the frequency pattern for the Pacific fault. The last large quake

              was 300 years ago. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Preparedness</b>                The number one priority in an earthquake is to protect your

                head. The old wives&rsquo; tale

                  that said we were safest in a doorway is NOT TRUE. Get under

              tables or on the floor beside a couch.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Everyone

                  needs to have a plan. Decide where you could go in each room

                  of your house, where you can get low and protect your head.

                  If a big earthquake hits, you won&rsquo;t have a lot of

                time. If you have already planned and practiced what you are

                going to do (depending on where you are), you will be much better

                off.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Diane noted that there was an acknowledged impulse to run outside.

                This is not the best because there are dangers outside. Objects

                can be flying through the air.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <b>Out

                  of Area Contact</b> A very important thing for everyone to

                  do is determine an out-of-area (at least 100 miles away) relative

                or friend that everyone in your family is told to call. This

                is because long distance lines will be available before local

                lines in a disaster situation. So if everyone calls an out-of-area

                number and tells the relative/</font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">friend

                that they are okay, then when the next member of the family calls

                that same out-of-area number and finds out who is okay and adds

                the information that they are okay.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <b>Water

                  Storage</b> We need to have three (3) gallons of water for each

                  person in storage &ndash; at a minimum. And, not just

                any water container will do! There are no standards for bottled

                water and the bottles used to sell water generally are just made

                to recycle. Diane told us that we need to buy carbonated pop

                or water bottles to obtain the much stronger bottles that are

                used for such products. Not only are the bottles stronger, but

                the caps are much stronger, too, for sealing the bottle to retain

                the carbonation. There are very detailed instructions in the

                Getting Ready . . . SDART&rsquo;s guide to Personal &amp; Neighborhood

                Preparedness. The water bottles need to be rotated every six

                months and you need to fill the water (after cleaning the bottles &ndash; see

                page 6) with water from the tap! A lot of people have Brita water

                purifiers, but in this case the water from the tap will store

                best for six months in the bottles and is what should be used. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <b>Radio</b>                Make sure that you have a battery powered radio to use in times

                when there is no electricity. Make sure you have extra batteries

                for the radio.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <b>Preparedness

                  at Work</b> It is necessary to assess your workplace situation.

                  You should have stored water there, as well as good walking

                  shoes, and a hard hat. Plan your route home. Diane noted that

                  the Aurora Bridge has been retrofitted.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <b>SOS

                    Products.com.</b> Diane told us that there was a website SOS

                Products.com that sold all sorts of useful products. You can

                obtain a free catalogue and get 10% off your first order if you

                say that you are with an SDART group.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <b>Natural

                  Gas</b>  If necessary, turn off your natural gas. Signs that tell

                  you it is necessary to turn off your natural gas are if you:

                  (1) can smell gas; (2) hear a hissing sound; (3) see disruption

                  in the street; or (4) see unusual activity on the gas meter

                  to indicate a leak. This means you have to know what normal

                  activity looks like on the gauge. Diane said that if you have

                  gas, you have make &ldquo;friends&rdquo; with

                  your gas meter. It is also necessary to have the tool to shut

                  off your gas main (which is outside your house) and keep that

                  tool close to the gas meter. She also said to make sure you

                  can move the gas valve. If you periodically move the valve

                  slightly in each direction, you will know that it has not frozen

                up and you will be able to shut it off in an emergency.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It

                  was stressed to not turn off your natural gas unnecessarily.

                  If you have shut off your gas, you then have to wait in line

                  for the gas company to come and turn it back on. It is possible

                  for people to turn their own gas on, but then they take the

                  risk and liability of doing that on themselves. It&rsquo;s

                not a good idea.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <b>Water </b>Water is a precious commodity and in a disaster or emergency

                  can become contaminated. It is wise to turn off your water

                  until you hear from authorities that it is safe for drinking.

                So, locate your shut-off valve for the water line that enters

                your house. Make sure that you can totally turn it off.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <b>Electric

                  Power</b> Go to your fuse box. Turn off your circuits one at a

                  time, not in groups.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <b>Hot

                  Water Heater</b> Your hot water heater needs to be secured to the

                  wall. If you have recently purchased a new hot water heat this

                  will have been done at the time it was installed. If your hot

                  water heater is not strapped to the wall, have this done, and

                  done properly. Your hot water heater is a good water source

                in an emergency. If it is not secured to the wall, it may tip

                over and spill that precious water supply.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <b>Critical

                  Items</b>  Diane told us that it was necessary to keep critical

                  items under our bed &ndash; shoes

                  (not slippers), flashlight, hard hat, gloves, and signs (both

                  saying HELP and OK). One thing that can break in an earthquake

                  is window glass and things can fall. You need to protect your

                head and your feet.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <b>Fire

                  Extinguisher</b> Do you have a fire extinguisher? Many of us do,

                  but have never used one. Make sure your fire extinguisher works

                  and, even more importantly, that you know how to use it!!!</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <b>Neighborhoods</b>                Neighborhoods should also organize themselves, not just individual

               homeowners. This way efforts in an emergency can be shared,

               i.e., First Aid, Safety &amp; Security, Light

                Search &amp; Rescue, Sheltering and Special Needs, Damage Assessment,

                and Communication.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We should know when people are at home, where the elderly live,

                where families with children live, which families have pets.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This has just been a brief recap from an evening where a whole

                lot of information was given out, and from the questions and

                answers.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The meeting adjourned at 9:00 p.m.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Respectfully submitted,</font></p>

                6.8 earthquake that, &ldquo;Folks, this is not the big one.&rdquo; The

                6.8 earthquake originated along the Nisqually fault, not the
