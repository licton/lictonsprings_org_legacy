          LICTON SPRINGS COMMUNITY COUNCIL <br>

        </font></font>Minutes of Community Meeting, April 21, 2010,<br>

        NSCC Conference Room B2311 </p>

        <p>Directors Present: Liz Kearns, Jerry Owens, Tom Meyer, and Ellen Beck. </p>

        <p>Board Representatives Present: Ken Thompson (Liaison to North Precinct) and Kathleen Braden (List Serve). </p>

        <p>Visitors: Jean Wirch and Rick Klingele (from Greenwood Community Council). </p>

        <p>President Liz Kearns called the meeting to order at 7:04 p.m. and we had introductions around the table. </p>

        <p>Minutes: The March 17, 2010 minutes were approved as presented. </p>

        <p>Liz reported that she had received an e-mail from Bruce Kieser. He is not able to be with us this evening, but indicated that we can e-mail him any questions we might have (<a href="mailto:bkieser@sccd.ctc.edu">bkieser@sccd.ctc.edu</a>). </p>

        <p>NEW BUSINESS: </p>

        <p>NSCC Presidential Candidates<br>

          Dr. Ron LaFayette, President of North Seattle Community College, is retiring the end of the year. He has served as NSCC&rsquo;s chief executive since July 2001. </p>

        <p>Three finalists have been named to become the new president: Dr. Pamela Edington, Dr. Eileen Ely, and Mark Mitsui. Community members were asked to participate in the interviews of these three candidates. </p>

        <p>Tom Meyer reported on the interview of Dr. Pamela Edington, Dean of Academic Affairs and Chief Academic Officer at Norwalk Community College in Connecticut since 2005. She also served as dean and division chair of Social Sciences and Human Services at the College of St. Benedict/St. John&rsquo;s University in Collegeville, Minnesota, and as executive director of the Women&rsquo;s Center in St. Cloud, Minnesota. Tom said that Dr. Edington was very articulate and had an engaging personality. She has spent over 25 years in the community college system. </p>

        <p>Liz reported on the interview of Mark Matsui, Vice President of Student Services at South Seattle Community College since 2006. He has also served as assistant dean for Student Services at Green River Community College, before which he served as director for Student Success and Retention Services, director of Athletics, and as manager of the Wellness Center at North Seattle Community College. Liz said, because of Mark Matui&rsquo;s time at NSCC, he was well known to the panel. Mr. Matsui helped institute the first Work Force at South Seattle Community College. He indicated he wanted to establish a four year program (like Bellevue CC) at NSCC. Liz noted that Bruce Kieser has previously told us that NSCC wants to go in this direction. Mr. Matsui stressed the need for diversity and supporting services for minorities. </p>

        <p>Kathleen Braden volunteered to participate in the Friday interview of Dr. Eileen Ely. Dr. Ely is President of Western Nebraska Community College, Scottsbluff, since 2006. Her community college career includes service as campus dean at Laramie County Community College in Wyoming. Kathleen was assured she should make her own evaluation of Dr. Ely. She said she would share her thoughts and evaluation after the interview.</p>

        <p>LSCC Annual Election of Directors/Officers. Liz reminded directors that it was time to have our annual meeting regarding directors/officers. Liz asked Ellen Beck if she knew whose term was up this year. Ellen did not have the records with her, but she would e-mail the information to folks after the meeting. Liz asked everyone present whether they were willing to continue as a director/officer if they were, and if they were not, if they were willing to become a director. </p>

        <p>Jerry Owens, Tom Meyer, Ellen Beck, and Liz Kearns agreed to continue. Ken Thompson said he would continue his work as liaison to the North Precinct. Kathleen Braden said she would continue her work managing the List Serve. Jean Wirch said she would continue to attend meetings as a community member, but had her &quot;plate full.&quot;</p>

        <p>OLD BUSINESS: </p>

        <p>Land Use/Zoning. Tom reported that there was very little activity in our neighborhood. He noted that there had been some applications for unit lots on the other side of Aurora Avenue North. </p>

        <p>Northwest District Council. Jerry reported on the Northwest District Council. He said the NWDC was revising the process on how they make recommendations for street improvements. He said the Engineering Department was &quot;pushing back.&quot; Now the recommendations will be made every other year instead of annually. This has caused turmoil for the District Council. </p>

        <p>Next month&rsquo;s guest will be Sally Bagshaw. </p>

        <p>North Precinct<br>

          Ken reported that Mayor McGinn&rsquo;s legal advisor has no previous experience in government positions. Mayor McGinn has said he will come out to tour the North Precinct. </p>

        <p>There has been an uptick in home invasion robberies and in these instances the homes have been unlocked. This serves as a reminder to lock our doors in the evening! </p>

        <p>Tom notes that in the South Park neighborhood, where he also attends meetings, police officers are present at each community meeting. They have a higher incidence of crime in that neighborhood. Community members have been urged by the police to &quot;DO call 911.&quot;</p>

        <p>City Budget Meeting at NSCC. On Tuesday, May 4, 2010, at 5:30 p.m., there will be a meeting regarding the Seattle City budget in the cafeteria at NSCC. </p>

        <p>Our next meeting is Wednesday, May 19, 2010. </p>

        <p>The meeting adjourned at 8:32 p.m. </p>

        <p>Respectfully submitted, <br>

            <br>

            <br>

            Ellen M. Beck, Secretary<br>
