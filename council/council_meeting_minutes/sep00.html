      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Present</u>:  

        Liz Kearns, Jerry Owens, Randy Elder, Bob Messina, Wanda Fullner, Debra

        Stuart Ling, Martin and Laila Grassley, Harve LaVelle, Kathleen Warren 

        (Pro Parks), and Don Svetich (Aurora Avenue property owner).</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President 

        Liz Kearns called the meeting to order at 7:05 p.m., and those present 

        introduced themselves.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>Minutes</u>:  

        </b>The June 21, 2000 meeting minutes were approved as presented.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Liz announced 

        that Randy Elder was resigning as Treasurer.  It was moved by Randy Elder, 

        seconded by Jerry Owens, and unanimously passed by the Board that Debra 

        Willendorf be elected Treasurer, effective immediately.  Debra agreed 

        to take the office.  Thank you, Debra!</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>Treasurer’s 

        Report</u></b>:  Liz Kearns gave the Treasurer’s Report.  Licton Springs 

        Community Council has a balance of $446.14.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>Community 

        Picnic</u>: </b> A review was given by Liz of the annual picnic, and then 

        group discussion followed.  It was felt that the food was removed too 

        early.  People arriving just after 1:00 p.m. received no food.  This has 

        not been the case at our previous picnics and the consensus was that this 

        early removal of the food was unsatisfactory and must have been due to 

        a misunderstanding.  The children’s games were a great success, as was 

        the Bubble Man.  The band was enjoyed, but Liz felt the $400.00 cost was 

        too high.  Liz said she welcomed other music suggestions that anyone had.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The cost 

        of the picnic was $623.53.  Wanda Fullner said that she would check this 

        cost against our budget and report back to us.</font></p>

      <h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pro Parks/Parks 

        for All<span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:

none'>:</span><span>  </span>Kathleen Warren told us about the history of this 

        project.  She showed us a map of the City with all the locations of the 

        park projects noted, and also had several handouts for us.  She told us 

        that the $200 Million raised would be allocated as follows:  Opportunity 

        Fund - $10 Million; Purchase of New Sites Fund - $26 Million; Development 

        Fund - $102 Million; and Maintenance and Programming Fund - $61 Million.</font></h3>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A question 

        and answer session followed Kathleen’s presentation.  If this levy passes, 

        our North Park project will get much needed funding.  Liz noted that Edie 

        Whitsett supported Pro Parks and was organizing a phone bank and would 

        welcome volunteers.  Kathleen Warren asked if our group would formally 

        endorse Parks for All.  Wanda Fullner moved and Jerry Owens seconded that 

        we endorse Parks for All.  Discussion followed.  Randy Elder said he opposed 

        the proposition because it was too broad sweeping and there were other 

        departments (i.e., police department) that needed increased funding.  

        A vote was taken and the motion passed (six approving; two against; three 

        abstaining).</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>North 

        Precinct</u>:</b>  Randy Elder gave a report on the North Precinct.  He 

        said that anyone was welcome to attend the first Wednesday of each month 

        7:00 p.m. meetings held at the North Precinct.  Chief of Police Gil Kerlikowske 

        will speak at the October meeting.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>School 

        District Meeting</u>:  </b>Liz Kearns announced that Seattle School Superintendant 

        Joseph Olchefskie and/or John Richmond would be at a meeting Thursday, 

        September&nbsp;28<sup>th</sup>, to be held at NOAA, 1801 Fairview.  Liz 

        urged anyone interested to attend this meeting.  LSCC wants to keep on 

        the forefront our concerns about the Wilson-Pacific School site.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>North 

        Park</u>:</b>  Liz reported that Edie Whitsett had submitted a Matching 

        Fund Application on September&nbsp;18<sup>th</sup>.  The application was 

        for $20,000.00, to be matched with $25,405.00, for a grand total of $45,405.00.  

        This money would be used for Phase I:  completing the site survey, developing 

        a forest/vegetation management plan and creating an arts plan.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Liz said 

        there would be a fundraising workshop Monday, October 23<sup>rd</sup>, 

        from 6:00 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.  Everyone is welcome.  Contact Edie or Liz 

        for more information.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>Historical 

        Project</u>:</b>  Liz reported on the Historical Project since the head 

        of our Historical Committee, John Labovitz, is vacationing in Europe.  

        The Committee has chosen Mimi Sheridan and Carol Tobin to help us with 

        our historical pamphlet/book.  We are fortunate to have two such talented 

        ladies working for us.  Liz said that she and Debra Willendorf would be 

        meeting the following morning to work on the contract to be executed by 

        LSCC and our consultants.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>Neighborhood 

        Break-in</u>:</b>  Stuart Ling, a neighbor who has lived at 1626 – 100<sup>th</sup> 

        in Licton Springs for the past three years, told about a robbery that 

        had occurred on Septem­ber&nbsp;5<sup>th</sup> while he was on vacation.  

        He said it was the one day that his sisters were not there and so he thought 

        his residence was being watched.  Small items were taken from his home, 

        plus his car was stolen.  He was most concerned about checks that had 

        been stolen and cashed at various local banks on the same day.  He was 

        going to attempt to view the surveillance tapes of the banks and inquired 

        about running a notice/picture in our newsletter.  Jan Brucker advised 

        that this was not a proper step for LSCC to take since it opened us up 

        for causes of action (i.e., slander) since everyone is presumed innocent 

        until proven guilty.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>Zoning 

        Presentation</u>:</b>  Don Svetich, a property owner on the west side 

        of Aurora (946 – 103<sup>rd</sup>), made a presentation to the group.  

        He recounted with the help of charts and pictures the background for his 

        request to the City for rezoning and his experiences.  Those present were 

        supportive for his proposed zoning change.  It was suggested that Phil 

        Fuji would be a good person for Mr. Svetich to talk to, since he is with 

        the Department of Neighborhoods for our part of the City (and what Mr. 

        Svetich is seeking to do conforms with our recommendations in our Neighborhood 

        Plan), and if Phil cannot help him, perhaps he can refer him to someone 

        who could be of assistance.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>Northgate</u>:  

        </b>Jan Brucker announced that the south lot of Northgate has been put 

        up for sale by Simon Properties!  Jan said that the City was considering 

        purchasing the property.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The meeting 

        was adjourned at 9:15 p.m.</font></p>
