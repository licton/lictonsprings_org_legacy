              <p align="left"><font size="2"> President Liz Kearns called the

                  meeting to order at 7:00 p.m. Liz explained that Debra Willendorf

                  was excused. It was noted that because of her absence, there

                  would be no Treasurer&rsquo;s

              Report.<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Minutes:</b> </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

              July 19, 2006 minutes were approved as presented.</font></p>

              <P align=left><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>OLD BUSINESS : </b></font></P>

              <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>September 9th Picnic in the Park.</b> Liz

                  Kearns reported the picnic had been very disappointing. There

                  was very, very low turnout. It had rained early on, and this

                  might have reduced turnout, but it was agreed that the absence

                  of Larry&rsquo;s

                representatives cooking the food they donated was most likely

              a huge reason for the absence of picnic attendees.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">Spending $450.00 to pay for promoting

                  the picnic, having the marimba band Chuma provide music, and

                  the Bubbleman provide entertainment for the children, is too

                  much to money to spend for a handful of people. Regretfully,

                  we don&rsquo;t see how we can continue

                the picnic at this time.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Halloween.</b> Also, our other

                  yearly event, Halloween in the Park, has become more difficult

                  to put on with the loss of Larry&rsquo;s.

                The number of businesses that we approach has increased and it

                is more difficult to get donations. We do have $200.00 in our

                budget for Halloween at this time. Perhaps, without funding a

                picnic in the future, it will be easier for us to put on Halloween

                in the Park.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">Liz requested that the secretary

                  provide copies of the letters written to SAM&rsquo;s, QFC,

                  and Safeway, showing the 501(c)(3) number. Liz and Betsy will

                then go back to these stores to request donations.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">At present we have received a $25.00 gift card from Fred Meyer,

                and a $25.00 gift card from Costco. We also have the $25.00 gift

                card received from Costco last year.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">Ellen was also asked to prepare

                  a letter to PCC requesting a donation of organic apple juice.

                In the past our apple juice was been donated by Larry&rsquo;s.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">A great deal of discussion about

              Larry&rsquo;s Market followed.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Pillings Pond Preservation Society.</b> Liz reported that Wanda

                has sold the stock held by the Federation and the funds have

                been given to Debra for deposit in the LSCC account.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">PPPS is also investigating having an Eagle Scout produce a new

                sign for them. It was noted that this seemed to be underway since

                the former sign has been taken away.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Wilson Pacific School.</b> Liz gave a history of the Wilson Pacific

                School. In light of the announcements of school closures, Liz

                requested a letter of support be written to the Superintendent,

                School Board, Mayor, Department of Neighborhoods, and Police

                Department, advocating using Wilson Pacific as a school.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">Wilson Pacific has always been a focus for the Licton Springs

                Community, as it was for the Aurora-Licton Planning Group. A

                lot of discussion followed.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Northwest District Council.</b> Liz has attended meetings of the

                Northwest District Council for Jerry for the last couple of months.

                The Northwest District is made up of Haller Lake, Green Lake,

                Greenwood, Licton Springs, Broadview, Phinney Ridge, Carkeek

                Park, Aurora Avenue Merchants Association, and assorted Chambers

                of Commerce.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>North Precinct Advisory Council. </b>Liz

                  provided copies of the North Precinct Advisory Council Meeting

                  minutes for August. Ken Thompson is our representative at the

                  Advisory Council and provides minutes to us. City Councilmember

                  Peter Steinbrueck was the guest at the August meeting. His

                  theme for this year is &ldquo;Smart

                Policing.&rdquo;  He also spoke about the Geo-Policing study

                now being conducted. Councilmember Steinbrueck is quite supportive

                of public safety issues, and knows and agrees that we need more

                officers on the street. Ken pointed out that the City of Seattle

                has the same number of police officers as they had in 1973! The

                study talks about &ldquo;Just adding more officers to the force

                without knowing how to best deploy them won&rsquo;t get us the

                most bang for our buck.&rdquo;</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>DON Grants.</b> Liz reported that the DON grants are coming along.

                The grant for Licton Springs Park will provide a revised vegetation

                plan for the Licton Springs Park. The new assessment of the status

                of the wetlands will give focus for future work.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2"><b>501(c)(3).</b> Ellen reported that she is working on the 501(c)(3)

                paperwork, but is making slow headway. She asked everyone to

                think about what should be included in an LSCC history. This

                should also include plans for the future.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>NEW BUSINESS :</b> </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2"><u><b>North Highline</b></u><b>.</b>&nbsp; Liz provided copies of a September

                4, 2006 letter from the Maple Leaf Community Council addressing

                the pros and cons of Seattle annexing the North Highline area.&nbsp; This

                is the area just south of the southern border of Seattle.&nbsp; Discussion

                followed.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2"><u><b>People for Transit Now</b></u><b>.&nbsp;</b> This

                  group has asked to come and speak at one of our meetings.&nbsp; They

                  would give a 15 minute presentation about their initiative

                to increase bus transportation.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2"><u><b>November Meeting</b></u><b>.</b>&nbsp; The November meeting is going

                to be about 100th Street and the conceptual design for sidewalks

                from College Way to Aurora.&nbsp;  Hopefully a lot of people

                who live on 100th will be able to attend this meeting.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2"><u><b>Pea</b></u><b><u> Patch Garden</u>.</b>&nbsp; J.B. Hoover spoke about

                starting a small gardening project by his residence.&nbsp; He

                said it was amazing how interested people (strangers) were in

                what was going on.&nbsp; He also noted that the gardening project

                resulted in the disappearance of trash!</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">J.B. noted that his small gardening

                  possibilities by his house, caused him to begin his search

                  for a possible pea patch garden location in the community.&nbsp; He said he wanted to make sure

                that we knew of his efforts and approved of them.&nbsp;  Discussion

                followed.&nbsp; Everyone approved of the establishment of a pea

                patch garden.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">He described pea patches around

                  the City.&nbsp;  Possible locations

                within Licton Springs were discussed.&nbsp; The most promising

                site is perhaps where 92nd dead-ends (by Wilson Pacific).&nbsp; Discussion

                followed.&nbsp; DON grants are available to establish vegetable

                beds and providing water for them.&nbsp;  Suggestions were given

                to find out if that site was available.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2"><u><b>OPEN FORUM</b></u><b>:</b> </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">The meeting was opened to concerns of the community.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2"><u><b>Homeless People in the Park</b></u><b>.&nbsp; </b>There

                  was a discussion about the increased number of homeless people

                  in the park and their sometimes belligerent manner.&nbsp; People need to speak

                up about this.&nbsp; Also, if you are reporting a homeless person

                in the park, the non-emergency number to call is 206.625.5011.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">Our next meeting is Wednesday, October 18, 2006.</font></p>
