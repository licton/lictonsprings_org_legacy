              at 7:03 p.m. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Liz noted that because Debra Willendorf is sick,

              and Jerry Owens working, they could not attend our meeting.</font></p>

              <p align="left"> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because

                  this was our first meeting in the College&rsquo;s Green

                Room, a bit of exploration took place. It was discovered that

                there is a screen installed, so if future guests wanted to do

                a power point presentation or some other display, this is possible.

                It was noted that there is a bit of an echo in the room. It is

                a smaller room than the North Star Dining Room, but for most

              meetings would provide enough space. </font></p>

                  Newsletter</b><br>

                The Newsletter was discussed. Kay Mesirow

                does a wonderful job with the E-Currents, but Liz pointed out

                that we have credits for copies at the UPS store and need to

                take advantage of those by sending a paper Currents. She suggested

                sending out a paper Currents in January. We could give meeting

                dates and topics for the whole year, as well as information about

                Licton Springs Park, Pillings Pond, and Mineral Springs Park.

                We could also give information about the E-Currents and give

                them the instructions for joining the List Serve. We would have

                to pay for postage to send out the paper Currents, but we do

              get a discounted rate through the Federation.</font></p>

                  Day/Community Paper-Shredding</b><br>

                Kay mentioned receiving a flyer

                from NSCC about Earth Day. She also questioned everyone&rsquo;s

                opinions about a community paper-shredding event that she had

                e-mailed us about. There was interest. Kay said she would contact

                the people putting on Earth Day regarding the idea for a community

              paper-shredding day.</font></p>

                Liz related that Bruce Kieser

                had e-mailed her regarding his inability to come to tonight&rsquo;s

                meeting because of his upcoming vacation. He did send her comments,

              which she read to us:</font></p>

                is progressing. We will be ready to go out for bid in about April &rsquo;09

                with construction starting about July or August &rsquo;09. The

                normal Seattle City permitting process, including all design

                reviews has begun as evidenced by the two 4ft by 8ft signs now

                posted along College Way North. Of course, actual construction

                is still contingent on the legislature approving funding for

              construction during the Jan &rsquo;09 regular session.</font></p>

                  pharmacy, technology, anatomy, physiology, EMT) as well as

                  developing an integrated student tudoring center and student

              life center.</font></p>

                  bike lane, and curb parking. I do not know any details about

                  it, but the city is planning a community information meeting

              on the subject some time soon.&rdquo; </font></p>

                  Serve</b><br>

                Kathleen Braden

                asked about sending out neighborhood alerts to the people on

                the List Serve. The alerts would be about things such as the

                arson fires recently in the Northgate area. Discussion followed.

                It was decided that this was a good idea and that Kathleen could

              use her discretion in sending the alerts out. </font></p>

                  in the Park 2008</b><br>

                Liz said that it was already time to be thinking

                about Halloween in the Park. Flyers will be made up and the

                Halloween request letters need to be sent. Liz said she had

                not been able to talk to Betsy Weill before she and her family

                headed up to Lopez Island, but she would call her now. Ellen

                said she would get the letters out. </font></p>

                  Grant</b><br>

                There was discussion about the technology grant applied

                for earlier. It has been decided to reapply for a grant, and

                take advantage of the pre-application process to get feedback

                before submitting the application in final. Kathleen Braden

                volunteered to check with Debra Willendorf and get the status

              of the new application. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Website</b><br>

                It

                was noted that the website needs updating to reflect the new

                meeting room, etc. Liz said that anyone with time could make

                notes on what needs to be updated/changed on the website and

              e-mail to the rest of us. </font></p>

                  Jail Siting</b><br>

                Kay reported on the meeting held at the College

                on July 12, 2008 regarding the proposed locations for the new

                jail, specifically the site at 11762 Aurora Avenue North (site

                of Puetz Golf) in North Seattle. Kay said people from all the

                surrounding neighborhoods attended the meeting. There were displays

                of the jail sites and brochures and materials available. Senator

              Ken Jacobsen was there. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kay reported that people sat at tables and discussed how the

                jail would affect our community and what could the City do to

                remediate our concerns. All responses were written on flip charts

                and then each table of neighbors presented their opinions which

                were recorded for presentation on the Seattle Channel website.

                The primary reasons provided against the 11762 Aurora Avenue

                North site were (i) the proximity to seven schools (the most

                of any of the sites); (ii) the environmental impacts (site is

                very wet); and (iii) the fact that it is farthest away from the

                Courthouse. Here is the web link to the June 12th meeting. Also

                has the link to the Seattle Channel: <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/municipaljail/Feedback_7-12-08_Public Forum.htm">http://www.seattle.gov/municipaljail/Feedback_7-12-08_Public

              Forum.htm</a>. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kay said that Puetz Golf, a family-owned business operated for

                many years at the site, does not want to sell. The City would

                have to claim their property by eminent domain, and Puetz Golf

              would fight this action all the way to the Supreme Court. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Seattle

                Neighborhood Coalition</b><br>

                Ellen reported that she had not attended

                the jail meeting because of attending the monthly Seattle Neighborhood

                Coalition breakfast meeting. The guest speaker was Frank Chopp,

                Speaker of the State House of Representatives, and the main

                topic was transportation. It was a very interesting and well-attended

                meeting. There was discussion about the viaduct and it was

                stressed that the commercial traffic was being ignored in the

                discussions about what should happen to the viaduct. It&rsquo;s

                not just private people in their cars using that highway, it

                is also business/commercial vehicles of all kinds. Speaker Chopp

                seemed to understand that commuters use the viaduct during peak

                hours, and commercial traffic during off peak hours. That commercial

              traffic is necessary for the City&rsquo;s economic wellbeing. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ellen

                urged everyone to read the &ldquo;Summary Seattle Neighborhood

                Coalition meeting with Frank Chopp&rdquo; e-mail that she recently

              forwarded to everyone. </font></p>

                Use</b><br>

                Tom Meyer gave a report on land use. He said that

                there is a constant flow of requests for permits. He said that

                he still continues to see permitting relating to the buildings

                near Wilson-Pacific (that he reported on previously), even though

                the buildings have been complete for some time. Discussion followed

              about the construction. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tom also commented about the notice received regarding the DNS

                being rescinded on Aurora Avenue North. He said he would obtain

              more information on this. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> He

                  also reported that NSCC had filed to receive the permit for

                the Technology Building. He questioned why this was applied for

                now, so many years in advance. Discussion followed. It was agreed

              that Bruce Kieser could answer this question for us. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tom also questioned whether the College has done a fact sheet

              for public consumption. If so, this could be put in our Newsletters. </font></p>
