<b><u>NEW BUSINESS</u>:</b></font></p> 



<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

<u>SR99 Study Presentation</u>.  Nytasha Sowers began the presentation of the results of the SR 99 Study.  She covered the portion of the Study dealing with Aurora from the Battery Street Tunnel to North 145th  Street.  The purpose of the study is to improve safety and keep traffic moving.  Aurora is highway of statewide importance as a north-south route, but it is also a local street.  The portion of Aurora studied is the third most dangerous highway in the State of Washington.  There are many accident hot spots in the study area.</font></p>



<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rich Meredith pointed out that the occurrence of accidents had increased because of medians being opened up in the past at merchants' requests.</font></p>





<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Intersections that were particularly hazardous were intersections with three lanes of traffic.  Accidents occur at these intersections because pedestrians get safely across two lanes and then can be hit by the vehicle traveling in the curbside lane, that does not see them.</font></p>



<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was pointed out that pedestrian crossings in our section of Aurora come at too great intervals.  Rich said that one goal of the study was to have pedestrian crossing locations at equal intervals.  Pedestrian lights are also a possibility, or having an island that pedestrians can wait upon to make it easier to cross all lanes of traffic.  Bert pointed out that this could be dangerous and he waves cars along that stop for him, because of the danger of vehicles in the curbside lane not seeing him.</font></p>



<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another possibility from the Study is to implement southbound parking restrictions from North 110th to North 72nd.</font></p>



<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Liz passed out copies of a letter from Mayor Nickels that was addressed to "Aurora Neighbor" that described improvements to Aurora Avenue.</font></p>



<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jean Wirch pointed out the AAA gives periodic driver refresher courses.  She said that she and Ken Thompson had taken the AAA course and found it useful.  She recommended it to us!</font></p>



<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Crows</u>. Liz said that dead crows had been reported at 100th and Stone and also at the south end of Licton Springs Park.  These crows are being tested by the Health Department to determine whether the West Nile Virus was involved in their deaths.</font></p>



<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Licton Springs Picnic--Flags</u>. Liz reported that four of Edie Whitsett's five flag/banners on poles had been taken by unknown persons.  This was lamented by all, but it was also pointed out that the time had perhaps come for the banners/flags to be replaced.  Regardless, it is a shame that they were taken.</font></p>



<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Greenwood Park/Sidewalks</u>. Bert said that groundbreaking for the Greenwood Park would be this fall.  Bert also brought to our attention an article from The Times describing Mayor Nickels plan to boost sidewalk production from five blocks a year to 35 blocks in 2003.  Bert said that five projects in neighborhoods were allowed by the funding at this time and projects had been rated 1-5.  Sidewalks for North 100th received a top rating.</font></p>



<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Mineral Springs Park</u>. The original architect, Charles Anderson, is back on the Mineral Springs Park project.  Edie is delighted, as are we all.</font></p>



<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>College Way Median</u>. Wally told us that on Friday, September 13th, the United Way Day of Caring, 85 Microsoft people, 20 Washington Mutual people, ten people from SeaTran, and ten to 20 volunteers from the College teamed up to weed the College Way median.  With that many volunteers, the work was finished by 11:00 a.m.  (AND it looks great!!)  Wally said that they had a barbecue in the courtyard after the median weeding with live music.  He said that the on campus area near the Child Care Center was worked on in the afternoon.</font></p>



<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wally told us that the College had hosted the District Convocation today. </font></p>



<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Stewardship Meeting</u>. Liz announced that she had received an e-mail from Dave Boyd, Northwest Sector Department of Neighborhoods Manager.  A Stewardship meeting will be held Tuesday, October 8, 2002, at the Phinney Ridge Lutheran Church, 7500 Greenwood Avenue  North.  The meeting is from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.</font></p>



<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Arts Organization</u>. There is going to be a meeting on Thursday, September 26, 2002, of the Seattle Art Commission.  Edie and JJ are planning to attend.</font></p>



<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>North Seattle Community College Open House</u>.Wally announced that the College would be having an open house Tuesday, October 8, from 5:30 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.  He passed out flyers for "North Fest 2002."</font></p>

<b><u>OLD BUSINESS</u>:</b></font></p>



<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

<u>Website--News Groups</u>. Bert Bradley gave a report on how News Groups can be organized by working with Yahoo.com or others.  He said that the Greenwood Community Council had both a news group and a discussion group.  Bert said that if we had a News Group, people could be given a link to our website in order to access our Newsletter.  We could develop a list of people who prefer to receive the Newsletter via e-mail and thus, we could reduce our mailing costs</font></p>



<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bert said that he would get information from Greenwood on how much time is needed to keep up the News Group and the cost of having such a group.</font></p>



<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Liz said that she would research how many people were visiting our website.  She said that it had been set up to include "hit points."  She said that she was told at one time that most of the visitors were from downtown.</font></p>



<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Wilson-Pacific Grass Playfields</u>. The grass is growing!!!  It looks great.</font></p>



<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Clean-out Vaults</u>.  Wally Fosmore told us that the work to install two additional clean-out vaults near the Meridian roadbed (on College property) was going to begin soon.  Wally reminded us that he had previously told us about this drainage project.</font></p>



<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Halloween in the Park</u>. JJ Avinger-Jacques reported that she had written a letter to the Costco manager regarding Halloween treats.</font></p>









<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The meeting was adjourned at 8:55 p.m.</font></p>
