              been presented. The award is signed by Dr. Kathleen Wolf, Chair

              Urban Forestry Program Manager, the Department of Natural Resources. 

              The award carried the seals of the Washington Community Forestry 

              Council, the Department of Agriculture &#8211; Forest Service, and

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></b>Debra Willendorf provided a Treasurer&#8217;s 

              Report for the period January 1, 2004 through October 18, 2004. 

              We have received $435.00 in dues, a decrease from last year, and 

              $475.00 in donations. Debra said that we had budgeted $500.00 for 

              the picnic, but only used $401.62. We therefore have a balance of 

              $98.38 in that category that was not spent. Discussion followed. 

              The Treasurer&#8217;s Report was approved.</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Stock:</strong> 

              Wanda Fullner reminded the Board that we have Microsoft stock held 

              in the name of the Licton Springs Community Council and the Federation. 

              This stock originally was given by a family to the Playground Committee 

              as a $2,000.00 donation. The stock has both lost value and gained 

              value. At this time $3,000.00 has been used and $1,000.00 remains. 

              Wanda suggested that the money go to the Pilling&#8217;s Pond Committee, 

              if needed, and if not used by Pilling&#8217;s, then kept for some 

              other special project of the LSCC Board.</font></p>

              He e-mailed Liz that &#8220;we are still planning to have the asphalt 

              walk install by end of this year. . . . .The only adjustment in 

              the final design is that there will be an infiltration trench (i.e. 

              something similar to a drain rocks pocket) running along the front 

              of the asphalt walk. I&#8217;m still waiting for the final details 

              from Seattle Public Utility. . . .&#8221; </font></p>

              some commitment of funds came with that rating. If that is so, it 

              is important for us to track that money.</font></p>

              event. Next year, we should approach SAM&#8217;s, QFC, Larry&#8217;s, 

              Costco, and Fred Meyer. This year we have received $25.00 from SAM&#8217;s, 

              $25.00 from Costco, and $50.00 from QFC. In the past, we have received 

              more than $100.00 from Costco. It was suggested that we have baskets 

              at the event asking for donations, with a suggested donation of 

              $2.00 per child.</font></p>

              PCC for their providing of greens for the ducks at Pilling&#8217;s 

              Pond. Liz suggested that it was time for the Board to annually acknowledge 

              help that we received. Possible recipients included Larry&#8217;s 

              Market, North Seattle Community College, and the North Police Precinct. 

              Liz asked members to think about what we could do. The timing for 

              our annual presentation would be in the spring of the year.</font></p>

              Department) had contacted her regarding the drainage &#8220;pond&#8221; 

              at the North Precinct and the development of a vegetation plan for 

              the &#8220;pond&#8221; area. Laura Nichols, who lives in the neighborhood, 

              has been making complaints and demands on the Police Department. 

              Sarah Cooke is now helping Laura and represents her with the Police 

              Department. To help the situation, there is a plan to remove non-native 

              vegetation and come up with a vegetation plan to improve the area. 

              The City is looking for someone with knowledge about plants to give 

              community input for the vegetation plan. Liz said that she would 

              get back in touch with Dave when he gets back in town.</font></p>

              be used to identify plants that clean polluted water and study which 

              plants do the best job. The grant will also study the question of 

              whether these plants, that clean up pollution, end up with toxins
