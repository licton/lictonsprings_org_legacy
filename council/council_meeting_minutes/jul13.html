Meeting at Wilson Pacific</U></FONT><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">.
 Liz Kearns gave a recap of what happened at the June 25, 2013
meeting at Wilson Pacific hosted by the Seattle School District to
give presentations and welcome questions and/or comments concerning
the elementary and the middle schools to be built at the present site
of Wilson Pacific.  The elementary school will be an APP school, but
the decision has not been made whether the middle school will be an
APP school or not.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Discussion
followed.  It was noted that the several of the mothers of elementary
school children were aggressively asking the School District if there
wasn’t a fourth layout of the schools not being shown that had the
schools at opposite ends (west – east) of the property, with one of
them taking the location of the present sports field, which they
discounted as being subpar and no loss.  The School District stated
that if the sports field was displaced, it would be rebuilt in
another location with no loss of the present size.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><U>Renaming
of Wilson Pacific</U></FONT><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">.  We
welcomed members and supporters of the Urban Native Education
Alliance in favor of renaming one/both of the schools to be built
after Robert Eaglestaff, an educator and visionary, who was the
principal of the Indian Heritage School.  His legendary and
remarkable leadership at the School saw the alternative school grow
to over 150 Native and non-Native students with graduation rates of
100%, with student success exceeding that of any other alternative
school in Seattle.  They came to our meeting seeking our support for
renaming Wilson Pacific after Robert Eaglestaff.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">There
was a lot of discussion not only about Robert Eaglestaff, but also
about Indian Heritage School.  All of our guests were pleasantly
surprised to find out that the LSCC has always supported the Indian
Heritage School at Wilson Pacific and is also in support of naming of
one or both of the schools in honor of Robert Eaglestaff.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Jim
Simmons, an educator and former principal, said that the School
District had always neglected Indian Heritage School.  The School is
at Northgate presently and that is not acceptable.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Wilson
Pacific and Licton Springs are sacred sites to the Duwamish and other
First Nations.  Chief Seattle’s Duwamish Tribe has considered
Licton Springs a Duwamish religious since time immemorial.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">An
application for landmark status and historical preservation for
Wilson Pacific has been made by Chris Jackin, whose organization is
Save Seattle Community Schools.  A decision is expected in September.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">It
is shocking but true that 30% of Native kids are put into special
education classes by the Seattle School District.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Rajah
Hawkins told us he had been placed in special education even though
he was intelligent.  When he went to Indian Heritage School they
asked why he had been placed in special education!  At Indian
Heritage he was on a team that participated in a Scholastic
Challenge.  Their team won against all U.S. teams and several
Canadian entries!  Superintendant John Stanford personally promised
Rajah in 1996 that Indian Heritage School would not be closed.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Someone

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">It
had been heard that Indian Heritage School is to be cancelled for
next year.  This has not been officially announced to everyone’s
knowledge.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Ideas
for publicity were suggested and included pow wow or potlatsch.  Jan
Brucker suggested a play.  Her daughter Lauren created an Our Town
project that included making over the play to the Indian culture.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><U>Card
for Mark Matsui</U></FONT><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">.  We all
signed a card to former President of NSCC Mark Mitsui, who is driving
across the country to become the Deputy Assistant Secretary for
Community Colleges in the U.S. Department of Education.  It was
decided that if LSCC gave him a $100.00 Starbucks coffee card, it
should just about get him across the country.</FONT></P>

Davies announced that the Master Bike Plan has been released.  It
includes a route taking North 90</FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">th</FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">
across to Greenwood.  This was discussed.  90</FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">th</FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">
is a long steep hill before a downhill to Greenwood.  It was wondered
if this was the best route possible.</FONT></P>
