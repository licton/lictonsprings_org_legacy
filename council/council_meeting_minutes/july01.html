        Liz Kearns called the meeting to order at 7:07 p.m., welcoming everyone.  

        We then went around the table and all present introduced themselves.</font></p>

        </b>The June&nbsp;20, 2001 meeting minutes were approved as presented.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>Treasurer’s 

        Report</u>:  </b>Debra Willendorf submitted a written Treasurer’s report 

        showing LSCC having a balance of $1,100.63 as of July&nbsp;17, 2001.  

        She also provided us with the finalized LSCC 2001 Approved Budget.  Debra 

        noted that checks would need to be ordered.  The monies for these would 

        come from the General Fund.  Cost-cutting and money-raising were discussed 

        briefly.  Liz noted that we could consider not having a band at our September 

        picnic in the future, as the band was a big expense ($400.00).  We could 

        not, however, ask for donations at our picnic.  Larry’s Market wants to 

        give back to the community by providing food and servers for the picnic 

        and are opposed to money being collected.  It was pointed out that the 

        picnic was an event where we traditionally gain new members, which is 

        very good.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>NEW 

        BUSINESS:</u></b></font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Licton 

        Springs Park – Vegetation</u>.  Ann Hirschi, Urban Forester with the Department 

        of Parks and Recreation, next spoke to us about the vegetation plan for 

        the Park.  Ann, who has a background in architecture, said she had gradually 

        become interested in what was outside of buildings!  She told us that 

        the Vegetation Management Plan is close to being finalized.  She described 

        the vegetation in the Park and said that invasives were competing with 

        other plants in Licton Springs Park, one of the few real wetlands in the 

        City.  Phil Renfrow has done a wetlands study that the Parks Department 

        is taking into account.  Ann outlined methods that will be used in Licton 

        Springs Park:  placing woody debris to hinder invasives and let new plantings 

        take hold; nurse logs which will be planted with cedar or huckleberry 

        plants to help these take hold (the logs will be submerged and secured) 

        and will eventually deteriorate, adding to the richness of the soil; and 

        the use of hummock plantings.  They will also be trying various methods 

        of weed control.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ann Hirschi 

        said that the Parks Department has had conversations with and will be 

        working with Earth Corps and SPU (hopefully SPU would have monies to spend 

        on the watershed – perhaps in the range of  $50,000.00/year for three 

        years), and will continue to work with TREEmendous.  The work at the Park 

        is to start this fall with weeding, planting, and mulching.  Parks is 

        also talking to the Conservation Corps and is hopeful they will get contributions 

        of manpower from them, as well, of course, members of the community.  

        Additionally, Ann said they hoped to get funding for an additional studies 

        of the iron spring and mineral spring at the Park</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Eleanor Mason, 

        Seattle Parks Department, Project Manager for bridge replacement at Licton 

        Springs Park, said that SPU now knows that they will not be expanding 

        drainage around Licton Springs Park.  The Densmore Drainage Study has 

        concluded that 33 acres are needed in the north end, and so they will 

        look elsewhere.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Liz Kearns 

        acknowledged the contributions of TREEmendous at Licton Springs Park.  

        They have had work parties at the Park every month.  Liz also mentioned 

        receiving a postcard from King County about “WaterWorks” funds.  She said 

        that she would get more information about this source of funding.  Liz 

        said that she was very interested in pursuing funding sources for the 

        pond.  She said that she would talk to neighbors around the Park, as there 

        are certainly community members interested in helping keep the pond “healthy.”  

        The pond needs cleaning out, dredging, and perhaps the artificial bottom 

        needs to be removed.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ann Hirschi 

        mentioned that there is a new “Adopt a Creek” Program.  She said that 

        she would get us information on this program.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Liz mentioned 

        that the Licton Springs Community Picnic will be September&nbsp;8<sup>th</sup>, 

        from 11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.  She extended an invitation to our guests 

        to attend our picnic.  A new special event this year will be a presentation 

        by an 11-year old girl from our neighborhood.  She will read from a book 

        by Emily Inez Denny which describes a time in Licton Springs when Emily 

        and her family were frightened by a mother bear with cubs and had to climb 

        up a tree to reach safety!  The young lady will be dressed in period similar 

        clothing, which Liz and the girl’s mother are making after conferring 

        with folks at MOHAI.  TREEmendous will also have a work party at the Park 

        that day.  This is a good coincidence because it will make people more 

        aware of the work being done in the Park.  Liz asked if they could have 

        an informational flyer and Morgan Dutton indicated that would be possible.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Licton 

        Springs Park – Bridges</u>.  Liz next presented a support letter written 

        by Wanda Fullner for the work the Parks Department is doing in connection 

        with bridges.  Eleanor Mason explained that the support letter was needed 

        for a submission being made to an internal fund to support existing projects 

        that have been under-funded.  It is necessary to evidence community support 

        for the project.  The support letter and signing page were passed around 

        the table for review and signing.  It was explained that the support letter 

        and page of supporting signatures was more than adequate because the letter 

        was fulfilling a technicality.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Secondly, 

        a letter regarding re-naming of North Seattle Park was passed around for 

        review and signature by those favoring re-naming the Park “Mineral Springs 

        Park.”</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>TREEmendous 

        Seattle</u>.  Morgan Dutton described the proposal they are submitting 

        to Natural Resource Stewardship Network for funding of the “Outdoor Native 

        Ecology Studies Program.”  They are proposing to partner with students 

        at American Indian Heritage School, Garfield High School, Nova Alternative 

        High School, and with North Seattle Community College, and the University 

        of Washington, providing training in urban ecology and ecological restoration.  

        Other partners in this program would be the Seattle Parks Department, 

        Earth Corps, Sheldon and Associates, University of Washington College 

        of Forest Resources, Friends of Frink Park, and, hopefully the Licton 

        Springs Community Council.  We agreed to write a letter in support of 

        the program, which Jerry Owens, Yvonne Zoretic, Debra Willendorf, and 

        Ellen will sign on behalf of the Board.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Morgan 

        said that TREEmendous also hoped to do a demonstration garden at North 

        Seattle Community College, if the College was desirous of this, informational 

        signage, and an instruction book created.  She said that SPU funds would 

        be used as a match, plus volunteer hours.  She said the goal in the work 

        being done at Licton Springs Park is to get the Park to the point where 

        it can be self-sustaining.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>OLD 

        BUSINESS:</u></b></font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Licton 

        Springs Community Picnic</u>.  Liz announced that she will have flyers 

        printed up to advertise the picnic.  She will drop off copies of the flyer 

        to each Board member and asks that we pass these out on our streets.  

        She also said that people could help by coming early to the picnic.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Pilling’s 

        Pond Small and Simple</u>.  The Small and Simple Application has been 

        submitted.  Wanda Fullner said that the Committee had learned that one 

        fourth of what goes through the pipe and through Pilling’s Pond is untreated 

        runoff.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>North 

        Seattle Community College</u>.  Wally Fosmore provided us with copies 

        of the North Seattle Community College Major Institution Master Plans 

        Annual Status Report – July 1, 1999 to June 30, 2000.  Wally pointed out 

        that the logical group to review this Report (and future reports) is the 

        Licton Springs Community Council.  He asked that we go through the Report 

        and let him know if we had any questions or comments.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Intermediate 

        Capacity Transit – Meeting Report</u>.  Jan Brucker and Jerry Owens reported 

        on a recent transit meeting they had attended.  This transit group is 

        separate from the monorail group.  It is a group which is looking at nine 

        routes and studying three different modes – elevated, streetcars, and 

        bus rapid transit.  The plan is to use existing right-of-ways and not 

        widen streets.  The cost per mile for the different types of transportation 

        is:  $40-50 Million for trolleys, streetcars, $70-80 Million for elevated 

        transit (trains, monorails), and $13 Million for buses.  Jerry said that 

        he had forwarded a schedule of meetings to us via e-mail.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bert 

        Bradley and Jerry Owens agreed to coordinate a Transit Community Meeting.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Wilson-Pacific 

        Small and Simple</u>.  Jan Brucker reported on the Small and Simple Application.  

        She explained that the Seattle School District would prefer to wait until 

        this fall to move forward, because at that time they would know what kind 

        of programs would be going on at the site.  Jan stressed that it was important 

        to keep talking with the School District.  A discussion followed regarding 

        dealing with School District personnel.  Jan said that it was important 

        to send a letter to Superintendent Olchefske and Ken Bounds regarding 

        the ball fields and landscaping.  She felt the public meetings organized 

        by the School District did not adequately address the concerns of the 

        community or solicit the opinions of the community, but were more “instructional” 

        meetings.  Jan said that discussions were continuing about Wilson-Pacific 

        wherein the community was not being included.  Artificial turf is continuing 

        to be discussed, even though we were told that there was only funding 

        to put in natural turf.</font></p>
