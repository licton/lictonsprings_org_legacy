        well as a comparison between the 2000 budget and proposed 2001 budget.  

        The report and 2001 budget were unanimously approved.  Debra raised the 

        issue of changing LSCC’s accounting to a calendar year basis.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>NEW 

        BUSINESS:</u></b></font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Licton 

        Springs Park – Bridges</u>.  Eleanor Mason, Seattle Parks Department, 

        Project Manager for bridge replacement at Licton Springs Park, spoke to 

        the group.  She explained current requirements are that bridges over 30 

        inches over the ground need to have railings and meet other ADA requirements.  

        She told us that there is $50,000 of construction money to address the 

        bridge issues in Licton Springs Park.  This amount is not large enough 

        to fix all of the bridges.  She asked for our preferences.  A discussion 

        followed exploring possibilities.  Ms. Mason informed us that the comfort 

        station at the Park is in this year’s Capital Improvement Plan.  The comfort 

        station will be designed in 2002 and built in 2003.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ms. Mason 

        said that our bridges were put in 20 years ago.  She said an architect/engineer 

        was needed for the project, and told us she had contacted Peggy Gaynor 

        and Steve Worthy, neither of whom was able to take on our project at this 

        time.  She said she would be talking to Robert Foley, who was not only 

        a landscape architect, but also an engineer.  If he is available, it would 

        be appropriate for him to survey the Park in connection with the bridges 

        and come up with alternatives and costs for each alternative for us to 

        consider.  He also could do a plan for the whole bridge system and then 

        we could perhaps work on the bridges in phases.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The consensus 

        was that the community wants to preserve the character of the Park/bridges.  

        Liz Kearns wanted to include the option of not replacing the bridges if 

        their character could not be preserved.  Ms. Mason said that perhaps it 

        would be possible to meet the expectations of the ADA, but not require 

        every bridge in the Park to meet ADA standards.  We need to make allowances 

        so that people with disabilities can enjoy what the park offers.  Discussion 

        followed.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Debra Willendorf 

        questioned whether, even in 1998, there was enough money available for 

        all of the Licton Springs Park bridges to be replaced at that time.  The 

        answer was “probably not.”  Debra suggested that it was necessary to have 

        options presented to the community at public meetings.  She wondered if 

        it would be possible to have a public meeting the end of July for this 

        purpose.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Greg Nickels</u>.  

        Greg Nickels, King County Councilman, who is running for mayor of Seattle 

        next spoke to the group and answered questions.  Mr. Nickels lives in 

        West Seattle and has had a passion for politics from a young age.  He 

        worked on the campaign of Jim McDermott for governor and was an intern 

        for Warren Magnuson.  He said that he would focus on transportation, neighborhoods, 

        and public safety if elected.  He answered questions and related his areas 

        of concentration on the King County Council.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>North 

        Park/Mineral Springs</u>.  Liz handed out copies of a flyer for the June 

        30<sup>th</sup> Art-In-The-Park Event.  She urged everyone to attend.  

        Liz announced that Darwin Nordin is the artist who will be helping to 

        create works of art.  The Event starts at 10:00 a.m. and continues until 

        6:00 p.m.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Historical 

        Booklet</u>.  Copies of the “Licton Springs, A Neighborhood History” were 

        available.  Liz announced that Bert Bradley and John Labovitz had volunteered 

        to help get out the mailing of this booklet to the 430 people on our mailing 

        list.  Our return address will be used on this mailing so that incorrect 

        addresses can be culled out of our mailing list.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Wilson-Pacific 

        Small &amp; Simple</u>.  A discussion took place regarding the Wilson-Pacific 

        Small and Simple Application.  Phil Fujii noted that he was having meetings 

        with John Vacchiery and Kathy Johnson.  He said that the Mayor was sending 

        a memorandum to Diana Gale and Ken Bounds regarding their departments 

        supporting the community.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wanda 

        Fullner moved that the Licton Springs Community Council support the Small 

        and Simple Application being made in connection with the Wilson-Pacific 

        site; said Application to be reviewed by the Board.  This motion was seconded 

        by Bert Bradley and passed unanimously.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Pillings 

        Pond Small &amp; Simple</u>.  Wanda Fullner said that initially the Pillings 

        Pond Committee had been told that they did not qualify for a Small and 

        Simple because of Pilling’s Pond being on private property.  But further 

        research showed that they could, in deed, qualify.  Wanda passed out copies 

        of the Application.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ellen 

        Beck moved that the Licton Springs Community Council support the Small 

        and Simple Application being made in connection with Pilling’s Pond; the 

        final form of said Application to be e-mailed to the Board and final approval 

        to be obtained via e-mail.  This motion was seconded by Yvonne Zoretic 

        and passed unanimously.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Newsletter/Post 

        Card</u>.  It was decided to not have a postcard to advertise the July 

        meeting.  There will be a Newsletter for September, which Debra Willendorf 

        volunteered to oversee.  A flyer will advertise the picnic, which Liz 

        will handle.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Board 

        Elections</u>.  We have two vacant positions on the Board.  Ken Thompson 

        said that he is still considering whether to make the commitment, but 

        he is willing to be our representative at the North Precinct.  Everyone 

        agree that that was outstanding if he would go to the meetings at the 

        Precinct.  Ken said that he lives very close to the Precinct so he would 

        have no problem doing that and will report to the Board via e&#8209;mail.</font></p>

      <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wanda 

        nominated JJ Avinger-Jacques to serve on the Board and she agreed.  She

        Light</u>.  Steve Church announced that the remodel at City light was 

        virtually finished.  He said that the Hadley skating building had suffered 

        damages in the last earthquake and now is in hazardous condition and will 

        be demolished.  Mr. Church said that lot would be used for additional 

        parking.  He said that City Light was working on their landscaping and 

        planned to remove the “pipes” sculpture.  He said they would have other
