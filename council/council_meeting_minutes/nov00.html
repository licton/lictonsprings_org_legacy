      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300"><b><u>City 

        Owned Properties in Neighborhood/Possibilities</u>:  </b>David Hemmelgarn 

        gave out additional copies of the memorandum dated October 18, 2000 that 

        he had previously sent to Licton Spring Community Council members regarding 

        City-owned properties in the Aurora-Licton Springs Neighborhood Planning 

        Area.  He went over the properties included and a general discussion of 

        these properties followed.  Jan Brucker gave a recap of the ideas from 

        the Neighborhood Plan regarding the properties, and she volunteered to 

        the contract person for LSCC with the City.  Discussion followed on possibilities 

        to redevelop SCL parking lots (smaller community oriented businesses on 

        street level; parking garage above, or apartments above) and if the alleys 

        were made pedestrian only, access could perhaps be provided to businesses 

        located on Aurora. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300">The 

        site of the North Precinct was discussed, including the desire of the 

        Seattle Police Department to expand at that location and the difficulties 

        of doing same because of water problems.  Jan Brucker mentioned that Northwest 

        Hospital Clinic on Meridian was possibly moving from that location and 

        Jan suggested that possibly this could be an ideal location for the Police 

        Precinct to expand into.  Jan said that she had heard of an environmental 

        study group that needed space and could perhaps take over the present 

        location of the North Precinct.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300">Wally 

        Fosmore mentioned that SPU had approached the College about buying property 

        at the north end of the College property in order to build a water retention 

        pond, which would help with the water problems at the North Precinct.  

        Wally said that the College was not interested in selling any its property.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300">Jan 

        said that if the City owned the NW Hospital property, it would be an ideal 

        location to allow a southbound exit to Northgate to be built allowing 

        cars to exit directly into the mall (as they presently can from the northbound 

        lanes).  She said that the NW Hospital property would have ample room 

        for footings for a “fly-over” taking off from that site.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300">Bob 

        Messina mentioned that it was unsettling to realize that one owner could 

        be buying up lots and perhaps gain permitting from the City for a “large 

        box structure.”  It is disturbing to residents that a development the 

        size of Northgate North (Target and Best) was able to easily get permitted.  

        The residents of Licton Springs do not want to have that kind of large 

        development come into our neighborhood, but rather want pedestrian friendly 

        businesses.  It was suggested that zoning overlays need to be explored 

        and also design guidelines.  Perhaps contacting Mayor Schell would be 

        a first step.  Communities who have met desired growth need to have a 

        way to protect themselves from large developments which would dramatically 

        change their neighborhoods.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300"><b><u>Alternative 

        Sidewalks</u>:</b>  John Arnesen provided a brochure and described the 

        alternative sidewalk (pilot project) that is being installed on Second 

        Avenue Northwest between Northwest 120<sup>th</sup> Street and Northwest 

        117<sup>th</sup> Street in Seattle.  He said this street had not had street 

        improvements, sidewalks or drainage prior to this project.  He pointed 

        out that this was a fairly level street and the residents gave up parking 

        spaces for the improvements.  The neighbors do have access via alleys 

        to the back of their properties.  Everyone was encouraged to drive up 

        and check out the project.  The swales are vegetated and the plan is to 

        keep drainage above ground, which is a more natural method of water management.  

        The project costs approximately $800,000.00.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300">The 

        street was originally 60 feet wide and residents used the street area 

        next to their property for parking.  Now they have a sidewalk on one side 

        of the street, drainage system, limited parking spaces, and the roadway 

        now varies from 18 feet at Northwest 120<sup>th</sup> Street and at Northwest 

        117<sup>th</sup> Street, but in the middle is 14 feet wide.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300">There 

        was a discussion of desired improvements to North 100<sup>th</sup>.  It 

        was pointed out that this is not a level street and so would provide different 

        challenges than Second Avenue Northwest.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300">Wally 

        stated that the water collection system for the College’s parking lots 

        allows for a 30 foot drop in elevation.  He said the College’s system 

        has a rock bin filtration system that the water must pass through.  He 

        says that the filtration bins fill with dirt in about two years and need 

        to be cleaned out.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300">Shauna 

        Walgren next talked about alternative sidewalks.  She had photos of various 

        surface finishes and before and after pictures of blocks where the alternative 

        sidewalks have been installed.  Areas to check out are Northwest Blakely 

        between 25<sup>th</sup> and 29<sup>th</sup> (where the planting strip 

        is also the water detention system) and the North 87<sup>th</sup> Walkway 

        Pilot Project.  The City is exploring alternative sidewalks because the 

        cost is less than traditional concrete sidewalks and there is a possibility 

        to improve drainage with more permeable materials and/or systems.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300">Shauna 

        said that SeaTran is working with SPU.  New drainage codes will be coming 

        out in the near future and water quality regulations.  The Densmore Drainage 

        Study will include local drainage <u>and</u> local drainage problems will 

        be focused on.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300">It 

        was mentioned that the Council can make application in 2001 to the Neighborhood 

        Street Fund Cumulative Reserve Fund to possibly get funds to improve North 

        100<sup>th</sup>.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300">Phil 

        Fujii thanked Dave Hemmelgarn, John Arnesen and Shauna Walgren for coming 

        and speaking to the Council, and for the work they do.  They were all 

        given a warm round of applause.  Phil said that “these are the innovators 

        working for neighborhoods.”</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300">The 

        City needs a sidewalk fund and communities need to be saying this to the 

        City.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300"><b><u>OLD 

        BUSINESS:</u></b></font></p>

      <p style='

text-underline:none'><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300">:  

        Phil Fujii told us that we need to focus on our Neighborhood Plan in the 

        first quarter of 2001.  We need to prioritize our issues from the Plan.  

        This means issues/things stated in our Plan, not new (anything not previously 

        adopted from our Plan) issues.  He said that we need to come up with a 

        strong proposal for alternative use of Wilson-Pacific.  An inquiry was 

        made to Wally whether the College had any interest or need for space at 

        Wilson-Pacific.  Wally stated that the College is in year 4 of a 10-year 

        lease for space at Sand Point.  He said it was good for the College to 

        have a presence in an area away from the NSCC site.</font></p>

      <p style='text-decoration:

none;text-underline:none'><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300">The 

        North Seattle or Mineral Springs Park is well underway and it is not a 

        problem that we will need to go into the new year to finish the work presently 

        going on.  Liz Kearns reported that Chris Williams had possibly located 

        funding for the netting that needs to be installed at the south end of 

        the Park to protect cars and nearby property owners from being hit by 

        discs being improperly thrown by disc golf players.  She said that there 

        would be enough money to pay for the preparation of construction documents.  

        A letter is to be sent to Ken Bounds applying for $40,000.00 for the necessary 

        safety net under the Neighborhood Response Application???</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300">Questions 

        were raised about the Parks for All levy passed by voters this fall.  

        Phil Fujii said that funds would initially be used for acquisition.  Wanda 

        Fullner inquired how we should go about getting the Pillings Pond property 

        on the “list.”  She said that the University of Washington, Audubon Society, 

        Woodland Park Zoo, and NSCC could possibly interested in the Pillings 

        property.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300">Phil 

        Fujii said that he needed a small core group from the Council to meet 

        with him to prioritize our short list.  Liz Kearns, Bob Messina, and Debra 

        Willendorf (???) volunteered.  Phil said it  was important, with regard 

        to Wilson-Pacific, to have all jurisdictions (SPU, School District, Parks 

        Department, Sports Fields, the Mayor) working together and coordinating 

        their efforts.  We should be touching base with everyone.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300">Our 

        meeting wrapped up with Phil telling Liz to call Wendy Watson (615-1213) 

        to get the core meeting scheduled.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003300">The
