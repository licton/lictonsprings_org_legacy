      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><u>Minutes</u>:  </b>The 

        September&nbsp;20, 2000 meeting minutes were approved as presented.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Liz announced that she had 

        received Randy Elder’s resignation.  Randy has resigned as a director 

        because he and his wife are going to buy a home in Lynnwood.  Liz encouraged 

        all directors to bring (director) nominees to our November meeting.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><u>Treasurer’s Report</u></b>: 

        Debra Willendorf gave a Treasurer’s report showing the beginning balance 

        of $891.92 as of January&nbsp;1, 2000 and receipts and expenditures to 

        October 16, resulting in the LSCC present checking account balance being 

        $724.01.  Our EIF account currently has a balance of &#8209;&nbsp;$188.60, 

        but Debra reported that the deficit will be paid off when we have received 

        reimbursement for a Daily Journal of Commerce expense and also have submitted 

        another bill for reimbursement which was previously overlooked.  Our savings 

        account has a balance of $11.60.  Debra requested consensus allowing this 

        account to be closed and the balance moved into our checking account.  

        There was agreement to do so.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><u>NEW BUSINESS:</u></b></font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><u>Licton Springs Park</u>:</b>  

        Jenny Benz, Seattle Parks Department Urban Forester, made a presentation 

        to us concerning the plans for Licton Springs Park.  She gave an overview 

        of the Park and history of the reforestation program in the City of Seattle.  

        She told us that the Urban Forest Restoration Program was established 

        in 1994.  The goal of the program is to assess citywide what exists and 

        then identify projects for restoration.  The goal is to eventually have 

        a sustainable forest.  Ms.&nbsp;Benz talked about the vegetation that 

        exists at Licton Springs Park and answered questions.  She had a drawing 

        illustrating the Park and several trees close to the play area had red 

        stars on them.  She explained that these trees had been identified as 

        hazardous and would be removed.  She stated that the budget for the project, 

        including the initial study was $70,000.00.  <b>[Note:  This figure corrected 

        downward to $48,000.00 by Jenny Benz subsequent to our meeting.]</b>.  

        Ms. Benz said that there would be opportunity for the community to have 

        input on the project.  The plan is to begin planting in the spring.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">There is a public meeting 

        to discuss the Licton Springs Vegetation Management Plan scheduled for 

        November 2, 2000, from 7:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., at Wilson-Pacific School, 

        Room 307.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">There is a work party scheduled 

        for November 4, 2000.  Parks people (including Jenny Benz) will be there, 

        as well Tree-mendous Seattle people, and they will lead the work party 

        volunteers in cleaning out invasives.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Jenny Benz noted that the 

        bridges in the Park were scheduled to be worked on in 2002; any work that 

        SPU does at the Park will take place in 2004-2005.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Jan Brucker noted that it 

        was good to be using the Wilson-Pacific facilities for the November&nbsp;2<sup>nd</sup> 

        meeting.  She said that we should take every possible opportunity to have 

        a presence at Wilson-Pacific.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Jenny Benz said that her original 

        interest was in endangered species.  She said that an awareness of wildlife 

        would be incorporated into all the work she did.  She noted that there 

        were a lot of birds in the Park.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><u>OLD BUSINESS:</u></b></font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><u>Mineral Springs/North 

        Seattle Park</u>:</b>  Marianne Kastanas reported on how the project was 

        going.  She passed out “News from Friends of Mineral Springs/North Seattle 

        Park” which highlighted current goings on.  She also answered questions.  

        There was some discussion about the Kelm house.  Harold Schmidt said he 

        was against selling the house and he didn’t think it had been done legally.  

        Marianne said that the plans for the park included a proposed water feature 

        that would use the foundation from the Kelm house as a sort of cistern.  

        It was pointed out that the purchase contract required the buyer to fill 

        in the foundation after removal of the house and the contract could not 

        be changed after the fact. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Marianne mentioned that Ann 

        Paisley had talked to the committee about her experiences in Lake City 

        and how they managed to create Cedar Park from a former parking lot - 

        years of hard effort paid off.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><u>Historical Project</u>:</b>  

        John Labovitz (telephone 851-1051), chairman of the Historical Committee, 

        gave a report.  Suggestions for sources of historical information were 

        offered.  He said that the proposed contract with Carol Tobin and Mimi 

        Sheridan had been approved by the City and we were very close to having 

        it executed.  John said that next Thursday, October&nbsp;26, 2000, there 

        will be a community meeting in the President’s Board Room from 7:00 p.m. 

        to 9:00 p.m. and Mimi and Carol are especially hoping to get access to 

        old journals, diaries and photographs.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">John told us that our consultants 

        will produce (i) a written history of our area of about 20 pages; and 

        (ii) a folded brochure (11” x 17”) that would be a combination of printed 

        history, graphics, and photographs.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><u>Community Planning</u>:</b>  

        Jan Brucker passed out a memorandum directed to Liz Kearns and the Licton 

        Springs Community Council from David Hemmelgarn (City of Seattle, ESD 

        Facility Services) regarding City-owned properties in the Aurora-Licton 

        Springs neighborhood planning area.  Jan said that Board members should 

        review this memorandum and it could be discussed at our December Board 

        meeting.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><u>Northgate</u>:  </b>Jan 

        Brucker handed out a flyer and told about workshops to be held October&nbsp;26-28, 

        2000 and December 1-2, 2000.  Jan urged interested people to attend these 

        sessions, which are entirely open to the public.  Discussion will take 

        place regarding siting the public facilities for the Northgate area.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><u>NSCC</u>:</b>  Wally 

        Fosmore answered questions about the College.  He was given input on effects 

        of putting the RPZ in place.  It was reported that parking in the neighborhood 

        had improved and ticketing is taking place.  He said that the college 

        has sold more permits for parking in their lots.  The cost of these permits 

        is on a sliding scale, depending on how many hours the student is taking, 

        or the employee working.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Harold Schmidt questioned 

        the cell tower the College was putting it.  He objected to it and thought 

        it would cause harm to residents.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Jan Brucker asked Wally is 

        there were any plans for a performing arts center.  Wally said that it 

        was not on the horizon.  He said that the Arts &amp; Sciences Building 

        remodel had been approved by the Legislature and the College was waiting 

        to see if the $5 Million capital project funding would be approved in 

        the next legislative session.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Wally told us that the Interim 

        President of the College is Dr. James Ford.  Dr. Ford had previously retired 

        after being the president of Skagit Valley College.  Wally said that former 

        President Noble had been reassigned and the business manager had resigned 

        after problems surfaced earlier this year.  Wally explained that many 

        items were involved in the financial problems of the College, but a large 

        part had to do with offering too many classes spanning an overly broad 

        time period.  This required longer hours by the teachers and the enrollment 

        did not increase as had been anticipated.  He said part of the problem 

        also had to do with a pay dispute with part-time teachers and a retroactive 

        pay increase given to the part-time teachers.  He said that the College 

        was now offering the same range of programs as before, but fewer sessions.  

        He said they had had to reduce grounds crews by 60 percent effective July 

        1<sup>st</sup>.  This was a problem because the areas to keep up have 

        increased with the recent expansion.  Maintenance crews have also been 

        reduced causing a similar problem for the buildings.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">An inquiry was made concerning 

        the Indian Heritage students.  Wally said that they were in three classrooms 

        and there were a total of 65 students.  He thought they were doing well.  

        He noted that it had taken a big effort on the part of teachers and volunteers 

        to get the Indian Heritage students and accompanying materials moved over 

        to the College.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><u>Alternative Sidewalks</u>:</b>  

        Debra Willendorf stated she was interested in alternative sidewalks for 

        100<sup>th</sup> and wondered who should be contacted.  Jan Brucker explained 

        that SeaTran was the place to start.  A discussion followed about where 

        alternative sidewalks can be seen.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><u>Future Meetings</u>:</b>  

        Randy Elder has communicated that we should invite Police Chief Gil Kerlikowske 

        to one of our meetings.  It was thought that the Police Chief should be 

        invited to a larger forum.  It was noted that Mayor Paul Schell was at 

        the Maple Leaf Council meeting tonight.  Discussion followed.  It was 

        suggested that we invite Mayor Schell to our November meeting and invite 

        Chief Kerlikowske to a meeting arranged in conjunction with other communities.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><u>Greenwood Park</u>:</b>  

        Bert Bradley talked about the new Greenwood Park.  He said that they were 

        looking for volunteers and input.  The greenhouses are scheduled to be 

        demolished and the park is in an area fairly close to our neighborhood 

        between Fremont and Evanston and 87<sup>th</sup> and 90<sup>th</sup> Avenues 

        North.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><u>Sierra Club</u>:</b>  

        Brochures were available for an Urban Watersheds Forum to take place October 

        30, 2000, at REI on Yale Avenue.  The forum will focus on Thornton Creek.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The meeting was adjourned 

        at 9:00 p.m.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Respectfully submitted,</font></p>
