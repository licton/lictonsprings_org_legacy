   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Visitors</u>: 

    Dr. Ron LaFayette (President of North Seattle Community College), Liz 

    Ellis (Certified Arborist, Seattle Transportation, NTS Urban Forestry,

   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President 

    Liz Kearns called the meeting to order at 7:00 p.m., welcoming everyone. 

    We then went around the table and all present introduced themselves.</font></p>

   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>Minutes</u>: 

    </b>The July&nbsp;18, 2001 meeting minutes were approved as presented.</font></p>

   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>Treasurer's 

    Report</u>: </b>Debra Willendorf submitted a written Treasurer's report 

    showing LSCC having a balance of $491.84 as of September&nbsp;18, 2001. 

    Debra noted that we will again be receiving funding through Cynthia Sullivan's 

    office for Newsletter costs. Debra and Ellen were questioned by Liz regarding 

    their need for stamps.</font></p>

   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>NEW 

    BUSINESS:</u></b></font></p>

   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Dr. Ron 

    LaFayette, President of North Seattle Community College</u>. Dr. Ron 

    LaFayette, the President of NSCC since July, introduced himself to the 

    group. Dr. LaFayette has years of experience in the community college 

    system, serving (i) for 15 years at Seattle Central Community College, 

    (ii) at Spokane Community College, and (iii) at the State Board. He says 

    he is very happy to be at North Seattle Community College. He envisions 

    the College being a part of the community and wants everyone to work together. 

    He wants the College to be looked upon as a community facility/asset.</font></p>

   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. LaFayette 

    said that one of the first areas he saw needing attention at the College, 

    were the College grounds. Staff and facilities employees all worked together 

    to pull weeds and it made a big difference. Dr. LaFayette suggested organizing 

    a once-a-year cleanup of Meridian by the College and the neighborhood. 

    This suggestion was well received.</font></p>

   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. LaFayette 

    also mentioned the Central Plaza being near completion. He acknowledged 

    the hard work of Wally Fosmore on this project. Finishing touches are 

    still being worked on, but he said that he would let the Council know 

    when the dedication ceremonies would take place.</font></p>

   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Liz Kearns 

    noted that the North Park Committee had approached Elroy Christensen about 

    participating in the planned sculpture project at the Park. She said 

    the Committee and the Council were very pleased that Mr. Christensen is 

    willing to take part in the sculpture project.</font></p>

   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wanda Fullner 

    told about the Pillings Pond Committee's work to preserve the Pond for 

    the community. She said that the Pillings Pond Committee had approached 

    Seattle Community Access Network (SCAN) for assistance in making a promotional 

    video. She said that they had gotten excellent assistance from Peter 

    Lortz and Ellie Cauldwell. Wanda said the video was outstanding.</font></p>

   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. LaFayette 

    said that the College was going to have a studio on site and be part of 

    SCC TV (cable). This creates many possibilities for future cooperation.</font></p>

   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. LaFayette 

    asked about chamber of commerce or other groups he should contact. Liz 

    Kearns mentioned the Aurora merchants. Jan Brucker added that there is 

    a newly-formed Northgate Chamber of Commerce, which meets the third Wednesday 

    of the month.</font></p>

   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. LaFayette 

    mentioned that the College was still on the list of possible sites for 

    a community center. If chosen, the property to be used would be that 

    at the south end of the campus, bordering 92<sup>nd</sup>. The College 

    also has undeveloped land available for athletic fields. However the 

    Parks Department has said that they do not have funding for a community 

    center <u>with</u> athletic fields. Dr. LaFayette and Wally Fosmore both 

    said that they didn't believe that the College was at the top of the list 

    of possible sites.</font></p>

   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Liz Ellis 

    said that a group of University of Washington students had in the past 

    had the upkeep of the center median in front of the College as a project. 

    She said that she would check and see if there was a chance that another 

    group of students would want to take on the project and work along with 

    the College and community volunteers.</font></p>

   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Northgate</u>. 

    Jan Brucker passed out flyers for an October 1<sup>st</sup> community 

    event on the development of the south parking lot at Northgate. This 

    event will be held at Nathan Hale High School. She urged people to attend 

    to show City officials present that there is strong support of the daylighting 

    of Thornton Creek and the plans that the new buyers have for the 12-1/2 

    acre site. The new buyers have agreed to devote over three acres for 

    daylighting Thornton Creek. Jan said some City funding will be needed 

    to make the proposal more viable for the buyers. Jan said that the City 

    will also, possibly, consider tax increment funding for the development 

    of the site.</font></p>

   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Wilson-Pacific</u>. 

    Jan also told us that in the response she received back from the Parks 

    Department regarding the Matching Funds for the landscaping project at 

    Wilson-Pacific, there had been a second page on which there was a statement 

    that the School District would not support community involvement at Wilson-Pacific. 

    She apologized for not noticing this statement earlier, but stated she 

    felt it was poorly done by the School District not to formally tell us 

    of their decision.</font></p>

   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jan stated 

    that she opposes siting the community center at the college because that 

    would take the focus away from Wilson-Pacific and make it impossible for 

    us to go forward in our work to have a community presence at Wilson-Pacific, 

    which is part of our Neighborhood Plan.</font></p>

   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Liz Kearns 

    stated that Kathy Johnson and Lucy Morello will be coming to our October 

    meeting. It was suggested that Steve Brown and Barbara Peterson also 

    be invited. Liz said she would contact them to invite them to join us.</font></p>

   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wanda Fullner 

    said that the Pillings Pond Committee has obtained the services of a land 

    use attorney, Keith Dearborn, who will donate his time pro bono and work 

    on the conservation easement issue.</font></p>

   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Liz Ellis, 

    Seattle Transportation, Urban Forestry, Landscape Specialist--Traffic 

    Circle Rehabilitation</u>. Liz spoke to us about a new traffic circle contest 

    that will be announced in the next couple weeks. Applications will be 

    available from the Department of Neighborhoods. The idea is to encourage 

    people to improve traffic circle plantings and perhaps win a prize. She 

    said that there are 800 traffic circles in the City and about one third 

    of them need volunteers to take care of them. Liz Ellis had a lot of 

    information and materials which she shared with us. She told us that 

    we have ten traffic circles in our neighborhood. She said that it is 

    possible to apply for Small and Simple grants of $500.00 from the Department 

    of Neighborhoods to improve individual traffic circles.</font></p>

   <p style='text-underline: none'>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Liz Ellis also 

    told us the rules and regulations regarding them. She said that people 

    should report traffic circles if the vegetation makes it hard to see pedestrians 

    and bicyclists. She also pointed out that drivers cannot take shortcuts 

    around traffic-calmers in arterial streets. However, in neighborhoods, 

    shortcuts can be taken, but drivers should be cautious and look out for 

    other cars before taking a shortcut. Liz Ellis said that median/traffic 

    circles eliminate 90 percent of accidents where they are used.</font></p>


   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">General discussion 

    followed.</font></p>


   <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>OLD 

    BUSINESS:</u></b></font></p>

   <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Mayor's 

    Visit</u>. Liz Kearns announced that Mayor Schell will be coming to the 

    neighborhood on October 10, 2001 for a one and one-half hour visit. She 

    asked for three volunteers to ride in the van with the Mayor when he tours 

    the neighborhood. She said that refreshments will be served in Licton 

    Springs Park, for which Phil Fujii will provide the funding. The group 

    will walk from the Park to Wilson-Pacific and finally to Pillings Pond. 

    Liz said she will be sure to get the name and phone number of the Mayor's 

    aide to follow up with on items brought up during the tour.</font></p>

   <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Andrew 

    Morrison and His Murals</u>. J.J. Avinger-Jacques described the research 

    and steps she has taken on behalf of the young artist Andrew Morrison. 

    Andrew is the artist who has done the murals at Wilson-Pacific and who 

    wants to become an art teacher. J.J. reported that Beth Pflug and Laurie 

    Aimes have both visited the school and been enthusiastic about Andrew's 

    artwork. J.J. said that she would like to apply for a Small and Simple 

    Grant of $10,000.00 for Andrew to begin a series of murals (each of the 

    four sections would require a Small and Simple Grant) on the east side 

    of the Wilson-Pacific gym building that faces Wallingford. The match 

    for the grants would be the school walls, the donated paint, the donated 

    scaffolding, and community volunteer hours. J.J. said that she has, since 

    she began her research experienced broad community support. She showed 

    a notebook that had pictures of Andrew's artwork and also a section where 

    community members had written supporting comments.</font></p>

   <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

    School District has given conditional approval, pending receiving proof 

    of insurance being in place.</font></p>

   <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Andrew 

    Morrison has an Indian heritage. His father is a Haida Indian from Alaska. 

    His mother is an Apache Indian from Arizona. He envisions the panels 

    illustrating the different ethnic groups in the neighborhood.</font></p>

   <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Andrew 

    uses Sherwin Williams Krylon Spray Paint. J.J. has contacted Sherwin 

    Williams and is seeking to get them to sponsor Andrew for a National Ad 

    Campaign and to also sponsor his education.</font></p>

   <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wanda 

    Fullner moved that the Community Council endorse the Art Mural Project 

    with Andrew Morrison and appoint J.J. Avinger-Jacques as chair of the 

    Committee. This was seconded by Debra Willendorf and passed unanimously. 

    Great work, J.J.!</font></p>

   <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Transit 

    Meeting</u>. Bert Bradley announced that the Elevated Transportation 

    Meeting would be October 3<sup>rd</sup> at City Light. He reported that 

    Steve Church had said he was happy the community was using their facilities.</font></p>

   <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bert 

    said that meeting would give community members an opportunity to comment 

    on the route proposals that have now been developed.</font></p>

   <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 

    some discussion concerning when the Newsletter would be going into the 

    mail, it was agreed that the date of the Transportation Meeting should 

    be moved to <u>October&nbsp;10, 2001</u>. Bert said that he would e-mail 

    us when he got confirmation that that date would work for the Elevated 

    Transit folks and City Light.</font></p>

   <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Licton 

    Springs Community Picnic</u>. Liz reported on the September picnic and 

    handed out a recap/summary. She said that 800 flyers had been distributed 

    in the community for a $200.00 charge. Liz thanked Ken Thompson for arriving 

    early and helping her set up for the picnic <u>and</u> for staying late 

    and helping her take things down and put things away. She said that Janine 

    Van Sanden will provide recycle bins for next year's picnic.</font></p>

   <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Liz 

    said that next year the community will have to buy paper plates, paper 

    towels, napkins, ketchup, mustard, and ice. Larry's will provide 250 

    hotdogs and buns and all sodas. Liz pointed out that she had had to buy 

    50 additional hotdogs and buns (which Larry's cooked). Liz said that 

    she had approached Larry's last year about providing 300 hotdogs and buns, 

    but they had declined. It was suggested that perhaps we could inquire 

    whether Costco would donate 50 hotdogs and buns for our picnic.</font></p>

   <p class=MsoHeader><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Halloween 

    in the Park</u>. Wanda reported that we would again be hosting Halloween 

    in the Park. The event is from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.</font></p>

    to receive information and give comments on the options we have for bridges 

    in the Park. The meeting is on Wednesday, September 26, 2001 at the Wilson-Pacific 

    cafeteria, beginning at 7:00 p.m.</font></p>
