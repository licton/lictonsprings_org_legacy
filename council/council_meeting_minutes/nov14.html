was invited to this evening’s meeting, but the invitation was not
confirmed, and so he didn’t join us.  Jan wanted to talk to him
about College expansion plans.  Also, the College’s Master Plan
requires a community person be involved, and we no longer have a
regular attendee from the College coming to our meetings.  It’s
time to renew that.  President Brown will be sent another invitation.</FONT></P>

Jury Meeting re:  City Light</U></FONT><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">.
 Melanie Davies went to the first meeting.  She reported it was fun. 
There was a roster of 38 established artists, a lot of whom have done
works before.  Melanie loved some of them, but others she didn’t
care for at all.  She said she and others on the jury were instructed
not to look at the art as if it could be on the City Light site, but
look at each artist’s esthetic. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">The
art pieces are going to be outside.  There will be new artworks for
two sites and the budget for the projects is $110,000.00.  The
present art will not be removed.  Artists will come up their own
piece.  Their work doesn’t have to be quirky like the present art. 
What was really fun for Melanie was getting up and talking about
Licton Springs, showing pictures of Pillings Pond and other things in
our neighborhood.  She also provided the SEPA checklist which
provides a lot of information and a link to the Wilson Pacific
information, and our handouts.  The jury looked at the slides
provided by the artists and first narrowed the group to eight
artists, and then down to down to the top four who will be asked to
come in to be interviewed on December 8</FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">th</FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">.
 They came up with a list of questions to ask the artists and the
artists can bring their own materials and present themselves.  The
artists have full freedom to come up with the piece of art.  Several
of the artists are quite well known and fantastic, so it is not known
if they would have time or be interested in participating.  If any of
the top four declines, then artists will be selected from the top
eight, etc.</FONT></P>

Kay Mesirow told that she had followed up on the link that Kathleen
Braden sent about books about the Denny family.  The book she checked
out was from 1966 and has obviously been well read.  She was quickly
excited.  Tom Meyer said that he had also put in a hold one of the
books.</FONT></P>

 As we learned following our October meeting, the Tent City 3
Offshoot moved out of Licton Springs Park the evening of our meeting.
 It’s our understanding that this group has now moved to North
Park.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">We
continued a discussion about housing the homeless.  A City plan to
address this issue is ten years overdue.  Jan spoke about the Seattle
Neighborhood Coalition meeting on November 8</FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">th</FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">,
which addressed the homeless issues and what can be/is being done. 
The consensus of all speakers was that there isn’t anything truly
being done in Seattle.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">One
speaker from Olympia talked about a community group that built
Quixote Village,</FONT><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="nov14.html#sdfootnote1sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">
which is a model for supportive housing for chronically homeless
adults in Olympia, Washington.  There are 30 small individual cabins
that have heat and electricity, half baths and front porches and
surround a community building that contains a full kitchen and living
room, laundry and bathing facilities, offices, and a meeting room. 
We were told the formerly homeless helped by painting their cabins. 
They house permanently 30 people.  The Olympia gentleman was a strong
advocate for private initiative to get projects like this going, take
it into your own hands.  Don’t wait for government because it’s
unlikely to happen.  </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Quixote
Village has a 40-year lease of some very poor land from Thurston
County, close to the industrial area, fairly swampy, but enough dry
land to build the Village.  They are not far from a grocery store and
bus lines.  This is senior housing, as opposed to families with
children, which would be a different thing altogether. </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">The
problem of homelessness in Seattle will continually plague us if it
is not properly addressed.  Jan suggested that perhaps we would want
to put this on the table to think about as a possible work plan for
next year.  She thought it was well worth it.  Since we are a
501(c)(3), we are in a position to raise funds, hold funds, etc. 
Discussion followed. We’d need to do a lot of research and we’d
need to widen the discussion and get a bigger group involved.</FONT></P>

Transmission Line in Residential Area</U></FONT><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">.
 Melanie provided updated information Sarah Benki-Nugent had
forwarded to everyone on her e-mail list letting them know that State
Representatives Jessyn Farrell, Gerry Pollet, and David Frockt were
being supportive of her positions to get the transmissions lines off
115</FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">th</FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Jessyn
Farrell reported to Sarah that Sound Transit is willing to “explore
moving the towers if we can get past two significant issues that are
impeding the towers from going in I-5 right-of-way.”  The issues
included sign-off from the Federal Highway Administration and if that
happens then the discussion would move to WSDOT.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">The
latest e-mail was from Tim Burgess.  He stated that WSDOT is not
going to do this.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Melanie
Davies stated her support of LSCC sending a letter indicating our
support saying we would like to have the City and Council continue to
pursue having these lines located along I-5.  </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Tom
told us that WSDOT regularly does transverse lines, but longitudinal
lines are difficult, though not impossible.  Longitudinal lines are
not their standard way to operate and they don’t like to do them. 
He reminded us that we already have lines in our neighborhood. 
Melanie stated that, yes, we have them, but on a main thoroughfare,
Meridian, not a totally residential street with houses.  </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">In

e-mail to Council Member Burgess and the people cc’d and state that
this is an important issue and LSCC Board supports and suggests that
the City and Council continue to look for a solution to continue
having the transmission lines on the west side of I-5 upon the edge
of their right-of-way.  She said that she would do the e-mail if
Melanie would forward the Burgess e-mail to her.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">At
the last District Council meeting, Tom spoke with the new Haller Lake
representative, who indicated that Haller Lake is not really rallying
around this issue.  He said that he considered this a very small and
vocal group.  And there are transmission lines all over the city and
it’s not that much of a deal.  There’s lots of precedence for
this. </FONT>

reported the event was very successful.  It was well attended and the
weather totally cooperated – no rain.  It was wonderful.  She
estimated there were 250 kids, and then also their parents, so over
500 people!  She again thanked Jan for lending her the mushroom
costume that Jan had made for Lauren years ago, and which Lauren
designed.  Melanie told us about a two year old who came up to her
and said with wonder, “Oh, you’re a mushroom!”</FONT></P>

did give some money back to a longtime Friend of the Forest who was
going to donate candy and who doesn’t have a lot of money.  Melanie
