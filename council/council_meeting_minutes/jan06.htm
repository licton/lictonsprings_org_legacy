                2100</b><br> 

                Jocelyn Freilinger told us the mission of Open Space

                Seattle 2100 was to design Seattle&rsquo;s Green

                  Network for the next century. She said that they were looking

                  at watersheds and where they have been altered, 103 years after

                  the Olmstead Brothers designed a park/green space plan for

                Seattle. She encouraged us to attend the upcoming Green Futures

                Charrette to be held February 3 and 4, 2006.</font></p>

              <div align="left">

                <p><font size="2">Discussion followed about the Licton Springs neighborhood and Licton

                  Springs Park, including problems because of dirty runoff coming

                  into the Park wetlands to remove non-native reed canary grass that

                  would take over if left alone.

</font></p>

                <p> <font size="2">Jocelyn said she would be working on Open Space Seattle 2100

                  until March. She hoped there would be a review document completed

                  by then. If there is not, someone else will be taking over

                what Jocelyn is working on.</font></p>

                <p><font size="2"> <b>Pedestrian Overpass at 85th and Meridian<br>

                </b>

                    Liz read an e-mail from a longtime resident in the community

                    living at North 86th Street. The resident wondered whether

                    anyone had ever suggested building a pedestrian overpass

                    over North 85 th at Meridian Avenue North. The resident has

                    seen many people over the years crossing North 85th at Meridian

                    instead of walking down to the crosswalk at Wallingford.

                    An overpass could provide for a much safer crossing of North

                    85th.</font></p>

                <p><font size="2"> This was discussed. Unfortunately, funding is very tight

                  in the City and it is doubtful whether funds could be found

                  for such a project in the near future. </font></p>

                <p><font size="2"> Bob Ferguson Town Meeting . Bob Ferguson is

                    holding his first town meeting of 2006 on Tuesday, January

                    31, 2006, 7:00 p.m. &ndash; 8:30

                  p.m. at Meridian Park Elementary School. The town meeting will

                  focus on emergency planning. Kay Mesirow and Melissa Coiley

                  said that they would be able to attend the town meeting.</font></p>

              </div>

              <p align="left"><FONT 

      face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><STRONG><U>OLD BUSINESS:</U></STRONG></FONT></p>

              <p align="left"> <font size="2"><b>Emergency Planning Meeting<br>

              </b></font><font size="2">Kay

                    and Melissa reported on the plans for the upcoming meeting

                    focusing on Emergency Planning. They also had questions. Discussion

                    about our March 15, 2006 meeting ensued. The cafeteria has

                    been reserved. It was decided that the meeting would go from

                    6:30 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. SDOT needs one and a half hours for

                    their presentation. There will be questions after the presentation,

              so time needed to be allotted for that. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2"> It was questioned whether we needed to have refreshments and

                a microphone, and if a microphone, what type. A stationary microphone

                was thought best. We will have cleanup responsibility and need

                to find out from NSCC personnel how to do the cleanup, what their

                system is. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2"> The potential number of community members attending was discussed.

                Kay reported that she had estimated from census records that

                there were 10,000 people living in Licton Springs. It was suggested

                that we could perhaps get pre-addressed mailing labels from Bob

                Ferguson.</font> </p>

              <p align="left"> <font size="2">The entities within the neighborhood to be invited/informed

                were discussed. They include: the Fire Department, NSCC, North

                Precinct, City Light, Oak Tree, Northwest Hospital, Aurora merchants,

                and Wilson-Pacific (Seattle Public Schools). </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2"> Having a signup sheet was suggested, as well as methods to

                get people to sign in. It was suggested we have people sign in

                on cards. Jocelyn suggested we could have the sign in cards used

                for a raffle drawing. This would make people want to sign in!

                She suggested the prize could be a first aid kit or crank radio.

                Both these items are needed in case of an emergency. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2"> We do have a credit at the UPS Store for making copies. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2"> Liz volunteered to call Neil Hanson of SPD regarding block

                watch. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2"> It was decided to not plan our second &ldquo;follow-up&rdquo; meeting

                on emergency planning at this time. SDOT has follow-up meetings

                planned after their initial presentations.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2"> <b>Crosswalks on 100th</b><br>

                Liz gave

                  an update on crosswalks at 100 th she had received from J.C.

                  Clapp. Ms. Clapp met with Megan Hoyt from SDOT and was told

                  that plans were currently being drafted to make extensive pedestrian

                  safety improvements on College Way between and including 97th

                    and 100th Streets. The plan should be done and ready for

                  community input and approval this spring. Due to the budget

                  cycle, it probably won&rsquo;t get built until

                next year, or possibly 2008.</font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2"> <b>Sidewalks on 100th</b><br>

                Shauna Walgren, SDOT Community

                  Outreach person, told Liz they hope to get the drainage issues

                  worked out by the end of February and the project underway

                  this spring. Ms. Walgren said that we might see people painting

                  lines (once we have dry weather). That will indicate they&rsquo;re

                close to commencing work.</font></p>
