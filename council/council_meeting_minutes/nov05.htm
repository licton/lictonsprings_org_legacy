                  at this year&rsquo;s Halloween

              <p align="left"> <font size="2"><b>Emergency Preparedness</b>. Liz opened

                  the discussion about emergency preparedness. She explained

                  that the Community Council had begun planning a large community

                  meeting. The plan was to try to involve agencies in the neighborhood

                  and hopefully to host and partner with the College in putting

                  on this meeting. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">Jeff Caldwell described what had happened at the College when

                the 6.8 February 28, 2001 earthquake happened. He told us 57

                light fixture defuser parts had fallen. Fortunately, only one

                student was injured. If the earthquake had hit at a later time,

              many more could have been injured. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">Jeff advised everyone with gas meters to have an earthquake

                valve installed. This should be considered a necessity because

                the valve will shut off the gas to your home in the event of

                an earthquake. These units cost $75.00 and should be professionally

              installed. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">He said that the North Precinct has contacted the College.

                In case of a natural emergency or other serious emergency, the

                North Precinct wants to base their command center at the College.

                The College has no emergency generators. The College would like

                to have 900 megahertz radios so that College personnel will be

              able to hear Police Department communications. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">Governor Christine Gregoire has required community colleges

                to participate in national incident planning strategies by September

              2006. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">Also, Nextel is planning to put generators at the cell sites

                and Seattle University is looking at the possibility of establishing

              a ham radio site. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">Bruce Kieser stressed that the College is not as prepared as

                it should be. He said the City of Seattle is a Community College

                District, made up of our four colleges, plus satellite locations

                of the colleges. They are in the process of establishing a preparedness

              plan. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">In 1970 the College was informed

                  that this building is on one of the fault lines that goes through

                  Seattle. Seattle has the potential of having the most severe

                  earthquake in the country. If the Zone 2A quake (7.5 &ndash; 8.0)

                  hits, this building will have some damage because of the tectonic

              movement. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">We need to plan around realities.

                  During the day, there are 40 people with emergency and first

                  aid training. It&rsquo;s a

                different story from midnight to 5:00 a.m. or on Saturdays or

                Sundays. The College is beginning the process to have emergency

              planning. Their goal is to be a &ldquo; Center of Excellence.&rdquo; </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">It was stressed that people should be prepared to take care

                of themselves not just for a number of days (with water, food,

              etc.) but for perhaps weeks. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">Mr. Kieser said that the College does want to co-sponsor the

                meeting with the Community Council. He said they want to be plugged

              into the community, and have community outreach. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">Seattle City Light, Northwest Natural Gas, the North Precinct,

              and Northwest Hospital should also be involved in the meeting. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">Jeff said the College wants to be in lock step with the community.

                He said he will be the community contact for the College. We

                can call him anytime. He can be reached at his work number: 206-527-3646;

              or his cell: 206-799-6072. His e-mail is <a href="mailto:jcaldwel@sccd.ctc.edu">jcaldwel@sccd.ctc.edu</a>. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">Traffic and Safety . J.C. Clapp, who is a mother and also an

                English teacher at North Seattle Community College, spoke next.

                She explained that she walks to and from the College daily and

                brings her young daughter, who attends daycare at NSCC, with

                her. She said it is very dangerous to cross College Way at North

                100 because there are five lanes of traffic, the speed of the

              traffic, and the lack of visibility. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">Possibilities are narrowing the street, or putting in a pedestrian

                activated light. Assessments have to be completed first. How

                many vehicles travel on College Way, how many people are crossing

              College Way. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">J.C. said a bus stop is at the intersection. This is where

                Running Start high school students cross College Way, as well

                as ADA, children going to the daycare, and other Community College

                students, as well as community residents who have business or

              classes at the College. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">Jeff stressed that just painting a crosswalk is not enough.

                A painted crosswalk gives pedestrians a false sense of security.

                A crosswalk alone does not ensure that cars will stop and allow

              pedestrians to safely cross the street. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">J.C. said she would be persistent in pursuing her goal of making

                100 th a safe place to cross College Way. Jeff said he would

                be persistent on behalf of the College. Jerry Owens said he would

              continue to raise the issue at the Northwest Council. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">Ken Thompson told us that he and

                  others had long argued for a light at 105 th. They did not

                  get the traffic light. Then a little old lady got hit crossing

                  there. George Benson, then a City Councilman, got the light

                  installed NOW. Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s what it seems to

              take. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">J.C. wants to make the intersection safe before someone gets

              hurt or killed. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">It was suggested that she contact

                  City Council Members David Della (Parks, Neighborhoods &amp; Education

                  Committee), Richard Conlin (Transportation Committee), Nick

                  Licata (Public Safety Committee), and Peter Steinbrueck (Urban

              Development and Planning Committee).</font> </p>

              <p align="left"> <font size="2"><b>Meeting of Planning Committee.</b>                Kay Mesirow reported that she and Melissa Coiley had met the

                previous week. They need more help and guidance. Where should

                the meeting be held and when? What was envisioned? </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">Discussion followed. It was decided that we are probably looking

                at holding our meeting in February. We need to publicize it and

                contact the agencies that we envision participating. We would

                like to schedule SDART people to be at the meeting and have SDART

              materials available. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">The initial meeting is envisioned as being informational. A

                lot of people should be interested in attending an informational

                meeting. Discussion followed. It was concluded that it was best

                to have the meeting in the gymnasium or cafeteria. We could organize

                a community workshop following that meeting. The workshop would

                go more in depth and would attract different people, people who

              wanted to be more active in preparedness planning and execution. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">Our next meeting is Wednesday, January 18, 2006. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font size="2">The meeting was adjourned at 9:15 p.m. </font></p>
