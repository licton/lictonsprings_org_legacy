Biology and Science Center will include a lab for anatomy, physiology
and biology with an intergraded prep area.  There will be a cafeteria
on the ground floor.  The construction is creating 142 new jobs for
the builders.</FONT></P>

did attend the Thornton Creek meeting last month.  They are doing a
study of the North Fork, trying to find out where degradation is
coming from.  They are using a test based on e coli.  They can also
test for DNA, using a system used in Portland, Oregon.  Thornton
Creek believes that the encampments are the source of the e&nbsp;coli.
 The water quality must be improved.  The next step is to open up the
area by the community center.</FONT></P>

Sweany, Project Manager for the Licton Springs P&nbsp;Patch, who is
in her fifth week in the position, told us that the P-Patch is going

Liaison &amp; Materials (Carol Howe, lead), Marketing (Emma Yip,
lead), Grant Documentation (Lindsey Gregerson, lead), Volunteer
Coordination (Vicki O’Keefe, lead), and Events (needs a lead).  She
said that the City wants more community members involved.  The
P-Patch will be done by the end of the summer.  More members are
needed for the steering committee.  It was suggested that perhaps
Roger Turner could be asked to spread the word.</FONT></P>

have to worry about the weather.  There is also the possibility of
options for other space on the campus.</FONT></P>
